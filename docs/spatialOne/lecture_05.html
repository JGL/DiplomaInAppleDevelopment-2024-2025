  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching some videos from WWDC.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10109/">"Meet SwiftUI for spatial computing" (26 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Take a tour of the solar system with us and explore SwiftUI for visionOS! Discover how you can build an entirely new universe of apps with windows, volumes, and spaces. We'll show you how to get started with SwiftUI on this platform as we build an astronomy app, add 3D content, and create a fully immersive experience to transport people to the stars."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10110">"Elevate your windowed app for spatial computing" (16 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how you can bring your multiplatform SwiftUI app to visionOS and the Shared Space. We'll show you how to add the visionOS destination to an existing app and view your app in the Simulator. Explore how your SwiftUI code automatically adapts to support the unique context and presentation of the visionOS platform. Learn how you can update custom views, improve your app's UI, and add features and controls specific to this platform."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10113/">"Take SwiftUI to the next dimension" (20 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get ready to add depth and dimension to your visionOS apps. Find out how to bring three-dimensional objects to your app using volumes, get to know the Model 3D API, and learn how to position and animate content. We'll also show you how to use UI attachments in RealityView and support gestures in your content."
  </div>
  <div>
    Together, let's continue Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials">Develop in Swift Tutorials</a> from Coding One - moving onto: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-spatial-computing">Welcome to spatial computing</a>, continuing to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/add-depth-to-your-app">Add depth to your app</a>, before finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/windows-in-visionos-conclusion">Wrap-up: Windows in visionOS</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, Apple has produced a set of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/introductory-visionos-samples">introductory visionOS samples</a>. Let's start exploring them: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui">"Draw two-dimensional shapes in your visionOS app with SwiftUI shapes or with your custom shapes"</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-a-new-swiftui-window-in-visionos">"Creating SwiftUI windows in visionOS"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/World">explore the Xcode project for the Hello World project</a> that we were introduced to at the beginning of today.
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
