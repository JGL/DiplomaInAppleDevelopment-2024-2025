  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your initial ideas for apps in groups. Who wants to go first? 7 minutes total each!
    <ol>
      <li>Three users from page 15 of the<a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a>.</li>
      <li>An (initial) paper prototype of your app!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>Let's start with reading about some of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/">the latest accessibility features from Apple</a>.</div>
  <div>I'm really interested by the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position">the veil of ignorance</a>, as well as the story about wheelchair access in the UK.</div>
