  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your initial ideas for apps in groups. Who wants to go first? 7 minutes total each!
    <ol>
      <li>Three users from page 15 of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a>.</li>
      <li>An (initial) paper prototype of your app!</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>Let's start with reading about some of <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-announces-new-accessibility-features-including-eye-tracking/">the latest accessibility features from Apple</a>.</div>
  <div>I'm really interested by the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position">the veil of ignorance</a>, as well as the story about wheelchair access in the UK.</div>
  <div>
    Let's continue with a video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10304/">"The process of inclusive design" (37 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how you can deliver inclusive apps that can foster amazing experiences for everyone who uses your software. We'll take you through best practices for creating and empowering diverse teams and explore how inclusivity influences every stage of the design and development process."
  </div>
  <div>
    And another video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10275/">"The practice of inclusive design" (35 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "An inclusive app or game is not only usable by different people, but also welcomes people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Discover how you can design inclusive content for your interface, language, imagery, and marketing materials and support the broadest possible range of people with your app or game."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/inclusion/">HIG's guidelines around inclusion</a>, as well as the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/applestyleguide/apdcb2a65d68/web">Style Guide's section on inclusive writing</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Another video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10034/">"Create accessible spatial experiences" (26 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can make spatial computing apps that work well for everyone. Like all Apple platforms, visionOS is designed for accessibility: We'll share how we've reimagined assistive technologies like VoiceOver and Pointer Control and designed features like Dwell Control to help people interact in the way that works best for them. Learn best practices for vision, motor, cognitive, and hearing accessibility and help everyone enjoy immersive experiences for visionOS."
  </div>
  <div>
    One more video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10076/">"Design for spatial user interfaces" (23 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to design great interfaces for spatial computing apps. We'll share how your existing screen-based knowledge easily translates into creating great experiences for visionOS. Explore guidelines for UI components, materials, and typography and find out how you can design experiences that are familiar, legible, and easy to use."
  </div>
  <div>
    A final video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10078/">"Design considerations for vision and motion" (15 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to design engaging immersive experiences for visionOS that respect the limitations of human vision and motion perception. We'll show you how you can use depth cues, contrast, focus, and motion to keep people comfortable as they enjoy your apps and games."

    The next lecture is two Fridays away, as I'm away at the <a href="https://www.kikk.be">kikk festival</a> next week.
    <br />
    Please review all of the content from today's and Wednesday's lecture.
