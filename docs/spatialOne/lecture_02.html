  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's go over your initial ideas for apps in groups. Who wants to go first? 3 minutes each, with one minute of feedback for each idea. Hopefully 7 minutes each in total.
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch a video all about Apple's prototyping process.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/">"Prototyping: Fake It Till You Make It" (60 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Make better apps by trying things out first, before you write any code. Get a glimpse of Apple's prototyping process and the range of tools and techniques we use, some of which might surprise you."
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, another WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/818/">"60-Second Prototyping" (11 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to quickly build interactive prototypes! See how you can test new ideas and improve upon existing ones with minimal time investment and using tools you are already familiar with."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's watch two videos from my laptop that Apple has deleted from it's WWDC video site:
    <ul>
      <li>"Prototyping for AR" (11 minutes)</li>
      <li>"Presenting Design Work" (16 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Have you ever heard of paper prototyping? Let me give you a quick demo.</div>
  <div>
    Let's finish with a video from WWDC:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10115/">"Design with SwiftUI" (20 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how SwiftUI can help you quickly iterate and explore design ideas. Learn from Apple designers as they share how working with SwiftUI influenced the design of the Maps app in watchOS 10 and other elements of their work, and find out how you can incorporate these workflows in your own process"
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    Next week, you will need to present on the Friday, as it's a (TBC) double lecture! We have a lecture on Wednesday 16th October at 0930 in PR_B501E and then a lecture as normal from 0930 on Friday 18th October at 0930 in PR_B501F. Please complete the following in time for next Friday:
    <ol>
      <li>I expect you to complete three users from page 15 of the<a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a>. Let's take a quick look at this slide together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, I expect you to come ready to present an (initial) paper prototype of your app!
      </li>
      <li>
        In addition, please review all of the content from today's lecture.
      </li>
    </ol>
