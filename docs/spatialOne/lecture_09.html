  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching some WWDC videos about RealityKit.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10080/">"Build spatial experiences with RealityKit" (28 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how RealityKit can bring your apps into a new dimension. Get started with RealityKit entities, components, and systems, and learn how you can add 3D models and effects to your app on visionOS. We'll also take you through the RealityView API and demonstrate how to add 3D objects to windows, volumes, and spaces to make your apps more immersive. And we'll explore combining RealityKit with spatial input, animation, and spatial audio."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10081/">"Enhance your spatial computing app with RealityKit" (21 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Go beyond the window and learn how you can bring engaging and immersive 3D content to your apps with RealityKit. Discover how SwiftUI scenes work in tandem with RealityView and how you can embed your content into an entity hierarchy. We'll also explore how you can blend virtual content and the real world using anchors, bring particle effects into your apps, add video content, and create more immersive experiences with portals."
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by reminding ourselves <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit">what RealityKit is, and how it relates to ARKit</a>. We'll be going into much more detail on ARKit in Coding 2 in Block 2. Recall that RealityKit has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/understanding-the-realitykit-modular-architecture">modular architecture - entities, components and systems (ECS)</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS is used in many games and game engines</a>. Let's read this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/implementing-systems-for-entities-in-a-scene">article that goes into more detail on implementing systems in RealityKit</a>. Recall that it's possible to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/creating-fully-immersive-experiences">have multiple fully immersive RealityKit scenes in a single app</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Let's watch another video, from this year's WWDC 2024.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10103/">"Discover RealityKit APIs for iOS, macOS and visionOS" (32 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how new cross-platform APIs in RealityKit can help you build immersive apps for iOS, macOS, and visionOS. Check out the new hover effects, lights and shadows, and portal crossing features, and view them in action through real examples."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/creating-a-spaceship-game">content associated with that previous talk</a>.
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
