  <div>Hi! Welcome back!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your App Design Workbook work in groups. Who wants to go first? 7 minutes total each!
    <ol>
      <li>
        Page 82 of the App Design Workbook: "Refine"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 92 of the App Design Workbook: "Define Personality"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 95 of the App Design Workbook: "Design Icon"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 99 of the App Design Workbook: "Define Tests"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 101 of the App Design Workbook: "Create User Journeys"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 102 of the App Design Workbook: "Define a Process"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 104 of the App Design Workbook: "Plan an Introduction"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 105 of the App Design Workbook: "Script" - this entire section, up to and including "Prepare"
      </li>
      <li>
        Between now and next term, I expect you to run your tests with users, then complete the "Validate" section on page 114! (Even Iterate? See page 121) - don't forget I'm away for all of the last week of term, a good opportunity to make lots of progress before the holidays.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <div>Let's continue by watching a WWDC video about RealityKit audio.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/111801/">"Enhance your spatial computing app with RealityKit audio" (24 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Elevate your spatial computing experience using RealityKit audio. Discover how spatial audio can make your 3D immersive experiences come to life. From ambient audio, reverb, to real-time procedural audio that can add character to your 3D content, learn how RealityKit audio APIs can help make your app more engaging."
    <br />How could you hack these hover effects? What if you had a grid of them?

    Let's continue by looking at this Sample Code article from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/simulating-particles-in-your-visionos-app">Simulating particles in your visionOS app</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at this Sample Code article from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/simulating-physics-with-collisions-in-your-visionos-app">Simulating physics with collisions in your visionOS app</a>.

  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    See you next Friday! Please review all of the content from today's lecture before then, continue Iterating your designs - see page 121 of the App Design Workbook. Each group will have 30 minutes for their Final Presentation Dress Rehearsals. Do you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_rehearsal">a Dress Rehearsal</a> is?
