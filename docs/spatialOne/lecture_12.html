  <div>Hi! Welcome back!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your App Design Workbook work in groups. Who wants to go first? 7 minutes total each!

  <div>Let's continue by watching a WWDC video about RealityKit audio.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/111801/">"Enhance your spatial computing app with RealityKit audio" (24 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Elevate your spatial computing experience using RealityKit audio. Discover how spatial audio can make your 3D immersive experiences come to life. From ambient audio, reverb, to real-time procedural audio that can add character to your 3D content, learn how RealityKit audio APIs can help make your app more engaging."

  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    See you next Friday! Please review all of the content from today's lecture before then, continue Iterating your designs - see page 121 of the App Design Workbook. Each group will have 30 minutes for their Final Presentation Dress Rehearsals. Do you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_rehearsal">a Dress Rehearsal</a> is?
