  <div>Diploma in Apple Development üçéüë©üèª‚Äçüíª: Product One: Lecture 1: Lecture 1: Introduction to the Product One unit.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    <p>What are we going to be doing in Product One? We are going to be using Apple's Swift Explorations syllabus and other Apple resources (particularly around SwiftUI) to make a whole iOS app, in teams. The brief is all around care. You need to make a caring app. But caring for who? How? Could it be around sharing important information? Which communities do you already care about or for?
    <p>In the second half of the year I'll teach you Product Two. It's solo brief around play - perhaps this could be around making joyful movement? You'll be researching the Swift you need with me along the way. Just like making a real app in the real world.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Some real world reference or inspiration for what goes into making an app:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.andy.works/words/the-most-satisfying-checkbox">How to make the most satisfying checkbox in the world</a>. I want you to be going to this level of thought and consideration on your apps.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/training_a_create_ml_model_to_classify_flowers">How to recognise flowers</a>. What kind of things do you want to recognise in the world? Why?
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/tracking_the_user_s_face_in_real_time">How to track the user's face in real time</a>. What could you use this for?
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>I'm going to be using Apple's Develop in Swift Explorations (Xcode 13) as the main text for this Unit - so please download it via the Apple Book store. See the course <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023/wiki/Reading-List">Wiki Reading List page for more information on where to get the book</a> - I really recommend getting the teacher guide too and downloading the project files for each book too!</div>
  <div>Let's start by going through the introduction section of Swift Explorations - paying particular attention to how the units are broken up into four sections (Get Started, Play, Build and Design), with Episodes between units. Again, making sure to download the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/explorations/xcode13/student.zip">student materials that accompany the book</a>.</div>
  <div>Now let's begin, with "Get Started with Values" - and I'll take you through some extra exercises as we start looking at the exercises in your student guide.</div>
  <div>Let's start with the "What Is Programming?" section and the Explore This exercise - "Consider your favourite app on your phone" exercise.</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Computers in Disguise".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Values" section and the Explore This exercise - "Take a photo of an everyday object".</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Using Data to Solve Problems".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Naming and Identifiers" section and the Explore This exercise - "Compare these two notes".</div>
  <div>Next a 10 minute 3 person group session - "Naming to Organise Values".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Strings" section and the Explore This exercise - "Imagine you‚Äôre tasked with creating chatbot responses to the user inputs below."</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Concatenating Strings".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Constants and Variables" section and the Explore This exercise - "Imagine your life is a program".</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "Ceteris Paribus".</div>
  <div>Next let's move onto the "Simulation" section and the Explore This exercise - "Imagine you work as a car safety engineer".</div>
  <div>Next a 15 minute 3 person group session - "It's All in a Name".</div>
  <div>Now let's read the next part of the student guide together - 1.2 "Play with Values". This is the first time we are going to try Xcode playgrounds. Let's start with the "Playground Basics" playground.</div>
