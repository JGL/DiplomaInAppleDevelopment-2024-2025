  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your App Design Workbook work in groups. Who wants to go first? 7 minutes total each!

  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by watching a WWDC video about making custom hover effects that are activated when someone looks at them.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10152/">"Create custom hover effects in visionOS" (17 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to develop custom hover effects that update views when people look at them. Find out how to build an expanding button effect that combines opacity, scale, and clip effects. Discover best practices for creating effects that are comfortable and respect people's accessibility needs."
    <br />How could you hack these hover effects? What if you had a grid of them?
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's finish by going through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/bot-anist">BOT-anist example code</a>.
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    See you this Friday! Please review all of the content from today's lecture before then.
