  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching a video from WWDC.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10083/">"Meet Reality Composer Pro" (22 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how to easily compose, edit, and preview 3D content with Reality Composer Pro. Follow along as we explore this developer tool by setting up a new project, composing scenes, adding particle emitters and audio, and even previewing content on device."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10202/">"Explore Materials in Reality Composer Pro" (21 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how Reality Composer Pro can help you alter the appearance of your 3D objects using RealityKit materials. We'll introduce you to MaterialX and physically-based (PBR) shaders, show you how to design dynamic materials using the shader graph editor, and explore adding custom inputs to a material so that you can control it in your visionOS app."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10273/">"Work with Reality Composer Pro content in Xcode" (35 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to bring content from Reality Composer Pro to life in Xcode. We'll show you how to load 3D scenes into Xcode, integrate your content with your code, and add interactivity to your app. We'll also share best practices and tips for using these tools together in your development workflow."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a moment to look at some articles and content that was referenced in those talks:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/designing-realitykit-content-with-reality-composer-pro">Designing RealityKit content with Reality Composer Pro</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/diorama">Diorama Sample Code</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue with some videos from WWDC about Reality Composer and making content for your spatial apps.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10102/">"Compose interactive 3D content in Reality Composer Pro" (35 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how the Timeline view in Reality Composer Pro can bring your 3D content to life. Learn how to create an animated story in which characters and objects interact with each other and the world around them using inverse kinematics, blend shapes, and skeletal poses. We'll also show you how to use built-in and custom actions, sequence your actions, apply triggers, and implement natural movements."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/composing-interactive-3d-content-with-realitykit-and-reality-composer-pro">content associated with that previous talk</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10186/">"Optimize (sic) your 3D assets for spatial computing" (23 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Dive into an end-to-end workflow for optimized 3D asset creation. Discover best practices for optimizing meshes, materials, and textures in your digital content creation tool. Learn how to harness shader graph, baking, and material instances to enhance your 3D scene while optimizing performance. Take advantage of native tools to work more effectively with your assets and improve your app's performance."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/presenting-an-artists-scene">content associated with that previous talk</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto four talks about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Scene_Description">USD</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklook/">QuickLook</a> - very useful for presenting 3D content easily in your apps.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10106">"What's new in USD and Material X" (10 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Explore updates to Universal Scene Description and MaterialX support on Apple platforms. Discover how these technologies provide a foundation for 3D content creation and delivery, and learn how they can help streamline your workflows for creating great spatial experiences. Learn about USD and MaterialX support in RealityKit and Storm, advancements in our system-provided tooling, and more."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10085/">"Discover Quick Look for spatial computing" (12 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to use Quick Look on visionOS to add powerful previews for 3D content, spatial images and videos, and much more. We'll show you the different ways that the system presents these experiences, demonstrate how someone can drag and drop Quick Look content from an app or website to create a separate window with that content, and explore how you can present Quick Look directly within an app."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10274/">"Create 3D models for Quick Look spatial experiences" (23 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover best practices when creating 3D content for Quick Look on visionOS. We'll explore a few different ways to prepare your models for Quick Look, cover important considerations for 3D quality and performance, and show you how to use Reality Composer Pro and Reality Trace to inspect and fine-tune your content."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10105/">"What's new in Quicklook for visionOS" (15 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Explore how Quick Look in visionOS can elevate file preview and editing experiences in your app. We'll cover the integration of in-app and windowed Quick Look, as well as a brand-new API that customizes the windowed Quick Look experience in your app. We'll also share the latest enhancements to viewing 3D models within Quick Look."
