  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's start by going over your App Design Workbook work in groups. Who wants to go first? 7 minutes total each!
    <ol>
      <li>
        Page 16 of the App Design Workbook: "Consider Diversity"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 17 of the App Design Workbook: "Summarize (sic) Your Audience"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 20 of the App Design Workbook: "Analyze (sic) causes"
      </li>
      <li>
        Page 22 of the App Design Workbook: "Research competitors"
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by watching a video from WWDC.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10111/">"Go beyond the window with SwiftUI" (24 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get ready to launch into space ‚Äî a new SwiftUI scene type that can help you make great immersive experiences for visionOS. We'll show you how to create a new scene with ImmersiveSpace, place 3D content, and integrate RealityView. Explore how you can use the immersionStyle scene modifier to increase the level of immersion in an app and learn best practices for managing spaces, adding virtual hands with ARKit, adding support for SharePlay, and building an "out of this world" experience!"
