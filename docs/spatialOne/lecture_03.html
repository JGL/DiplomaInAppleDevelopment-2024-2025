  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/802/">"Essential Design Principles" (60 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Design principles are the key to understanding how design serves human needs for safety, meaning, achievement and beauty. Learn what these principles are and how they can help you design more welcoming, understandable, empowering and gratifying user experiences."
  </div>
  <div>Next, let's watch some videos about designing for visionOS specifically.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/">"Principles of spatial design" (22mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover the fundamentals of spatial design. Learn how to design with depth, scale, windows, and immersion, and apply best practices for creating comfortable, human-centered (sic) experiences that transform reality. Find out how you can use these spatial design principles to extend your existing app or bring a new idea to life."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10096/">"Design interactive experiences for visionOS" (21 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can design a compelling interactive narrative experience for Apple Vision Pro from the designers of Encounter Dinosaurs. Discover how these types of experiences differ from existing apps, media, and games, and explore how to design narratives that bring audiences into new worlds. Find out how you can create stories that adapt to any space and size, provide multiple levels of interaction to make them accessible to all, and use animation, spatial audio, and custom gestures to further immerse people in your experience."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10086/">"Design great visionOS apps" (20 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Find out how to create compelling spatial computing apps by embracing immersion, designing for eyes and hands, and taking advantage of depth, scale, and space. We'll share several examples of great visionOS apps and explore how their designers approached creating new experiences for the platform."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10260/">"Get started with building apps for spatial computing" (32 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Get ready to develop apps and games for visionOS! Discover the fundamental building blocks that make up spatial computing ‚Äî windows, volumes, and spaces ‚Äî and find out how you can use these elements to build engaging and immersive experiences."
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10203/">"Develop your first immersive app" (32 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Find out how you can build immersive apps for visionOS using Xcode and Reality Composer Pro. We'll show you how to get started with a new visionOS project, use Xcode Previews for your SwiftUI development, and take advantage of RealityKit and RealityView to render 3D content."
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
  <div>
    On Friday, please back ready to present:
    <ol>
      <li>Three users from page 15 of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a>.</li>
      <li>An (initial) paper prototype of your app!</li>
    </ol>
