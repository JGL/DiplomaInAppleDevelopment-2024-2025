  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by working our way through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">Introducing SwiftUI</a> tutorial from Apple:
    <ul>
      <li>Starting with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views">Creating and combining views</a></li>
      <li>Next, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation">Building lists and navigation</a></li>
      <li>Next, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/handling-user-input">Handing user input</a></li>
      <li>Next, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/SwiftUI/drawing-paths-and-shapes">Drawing paths and shapes</a></li>
      <li>Finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/animating-views-and-transitions">Animating views and transitions</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Next, let's go through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/swift-splash">Sample Code for the app "Swift Splash"</a>.</div>
  <div>Next, let's watch a WWDC talk about making a spatial drawing app - warning - this has advanced content, but you can handle it.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10104/">"Build a spatial drawing app with RealityKit" (33 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Harness the power of RealityKit through the process of building a spatial drawing app. As you create an eye-catching spatial experience that integrates RealityKit with ARKit and SwiftUI, you'll explore how resources work in RealityKit and how to use features like low-level mesh and texture APIs to achieve fast updates of the users' brush strokes."
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at a recently posted <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/introductory-visionos-samples">Introductory visionOS sample</a>: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-a-painting-space-in-visionos">"Create a 3D painting space"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-a-spatial-drawing-app-with-realitykit">content associated with that previous talk</a>.
  </div>
  <div>What questions do you have for me?</div>
