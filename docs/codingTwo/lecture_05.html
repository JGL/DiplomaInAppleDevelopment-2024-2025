    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Today's lecture is going to be a deep dive into the visionOS sample code from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/placing-content-on-detected-planes">Placing content on detected planes</a>. Let's start by trying the app out amongst ourselves on one of our three Vision Pro headsets.</div>
  <div>Now ets go through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/placing-content-on-detected-planes">Placing content on detected planes</a> article and source code in detail.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
