  <div>
    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>This session is going to be a duplication of the workshop that I attended at Apple Battersea in November 2024: "Build great apps for visionOS with RealityKit".</div>
  <div>Before we go through that code, let's start with revising our understanding of RealityKit with the following three articles:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/understanding-the-realitykit-modular-architecture">"Understanding the modular architecture of RealityKit"</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/understanding-transforms">"Using transforms to move, scale, and rotate entities"</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/transforming-entities-between-realitykit-coordinate-spaces">"Transforming entities between RealityKit coordinate spaces"</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Let's get on with the workshop! It's split between Xcode and Reality Composer Pro, so make sure you have got both installed. They should come together. While you are doing that, I'm going to AirDrop all the files to someone - please keep passing it around to others to make this process faster! Inside the zip file should contain 10 further zip files.</div>
  <div>
    Each of the zips correspond to a task, and each task is broken down further. The nine tasks are:
    <ol>
      <ul>Assembling the scene in Reality Composer Pro</ul>
      <ul>Displaying your Scene in SwiftUI</ul>
      <ul>Applying materials to the scene</ul>
      <ul>Building the Settings UI</ul>
      <ul>Controlling the train's speed</ul>
      <ul>Adding steam to the train</ul>
      <ul>Adding light to the train</ul>
      <ul>Adding the whistle audio</ul>
      <ul>Stopping at the station</ul>
    </ol>
    If we run out of time (likely), please complete as homework! Remember - you can always look at the zip file of the task ahead in order to work out to do if you get stuck!
  </div>
  <div>1. Assembling the scene in Reality Composer Pro:
    <ol>
      <ul>Start with realitykit-sampleapp-start.zip</ul>
      <ul>Open and explore Reality Composer Pro</ul>
      <ul>Delete the default scene</ul>
      <ul>Create a new scene and import the model</ul>
      <ul>Rotate asset</ul>

      <ul>Adjust the volumetric window size (1.5m cube)</ul>
      <ul>Reposition the model on the surface of the window (y: -0.65m)</ul>
      <ul>Clean up, build and run</ul>
    </ol>
  </div>

      <ul>Get and play the baked animation in the RealityView</ul>
      <ul>Update animation speed slider</ul>
    </ol>
  </div>

      <ul>Parent the particle to the Locomotive</ul>
      <ul>Make any adjustments</ul>
      <ul>Build and run</ul>
    </ol>

      <ul>Configure the spotlight with the correct intensity</ul>
      <ul>Activate the shadow component</ul>
      <ul>Parent the new scene to the Locomotive</ul>
      <ul>Make the light toggle in App Model</ul>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>8. Adding the whistle audio:
    <ol>
      <ul>Add a new Scene</ul>
