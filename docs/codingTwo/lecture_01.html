    üëãüèª Hi! Welcome to Block Two! Well done on completing Block One! üéâ
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by looking at the homepage for Block 2, which is below that of Block 1: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/</a>. I'm going to be updating both Coding 2 and Spatial 2 as we go. So please say what you want to learn in order to support your solo Spatial 2 apps!
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's move on by reviewing the README.md for Block Two on the Apple Diploma GitHub: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/</a>. Don't forget to make note of the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/#block-2-assessment">assessment schedule</a> in your own calendars. As you know from Block One, assessment will be upon you before you know it! Tutorials will continue as normal on Monday mornings - please mark these in your calendars too - I'll post reminders on Fridays.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at the wiki for Block Two on the Apple Diploma GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/wiki">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/wiki</a>, paying particular attention to the reading list wiki page: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/wiki/External-Resources"></a>

  <div>
    For a bit of revision, with this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10184/">"A Swift Tour: Explore Swift‚Äôs features and design"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Our second bit of revision will be around SwiftUI, with this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10150/">"SwiftUI essentials"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>Let's start learning new things, starting with Packages. Packages are an easy way to use other programmer's code, but also to package up your code for others to use.</div>
    <div>Le't watch this video from WWDC19: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/408/">"Adopting Swift Packages in Xcode"</a>. You'll notice that Apple uses packages for Reality Composer Pro content when you use the RealityKit template in Xcode. </div>
    <div>Take a look at <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com">The Swift Package Index</a>, a community run but Apple sponsored website.</div>
    <div>N.B. If you want to learn more about how to create Swift Packages, see this talk: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/410/">"Creating Swift Packages"</a>, but that's beyond the scope of this course.)</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's move onto Symbols with this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10188/">"What‚Äôs new in SF Symbols 6"</a>. I'd recommend watching the previous "What's New in SF Symbols X" from the previous WWDC's as recommended on that page, but please do this as homework.
  </div>
  <div>
    Now let's take a look at how to animate in SwiftUI, with this video from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10156/">"Explore SwiftUI animation"</a>. If you want to learn more about using animation in SwiftUI, take a look at the following two talks from the same WWDC: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10158">"Animate with springs"</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10257/">"Wind your way through advanced animations in SwiftUI"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's take a look at the following pieces of sample code from Apple:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/adding-a-depth-effect-to-text-in-visionos">"Adding a depth effect to text in visionOS"</a> - this uses SwiftUI animation!</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-2d-shapes-in-visionos-with-swiftui">"Creating 2D shapes with SwiftUI"</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-3d-shapes-in-visionos-with-realitykit">"Creating 3D entities with RealityKit"</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/combining-2d-and-3d-views-in-an-immersive-app">"Combining 2D and 3D views in an immersive app"</a>.</li>
    </ul>
