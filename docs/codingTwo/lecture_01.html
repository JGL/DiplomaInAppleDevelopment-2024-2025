    👋🏻 Hi! Welcome to Block Two! Well done on completing Block One! 🎉
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by looking at the homepage for Block 2, which is below that of Block 1: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/</a>. I'm going to be updating both Coding 2 and Spatial 2 as we go. So please say what you want to learn in order to support your solo Spatial 2 apps!
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's move on by reviewing the README.md for Block Two on the Apple Diploma GitHub: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/</a>. Don't forget to make note of the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/#block-2-assessment">assessment schedule</a> in your own calendars. As you know from Block One, assessment will be upon you before you know it! Tutorials will continue as normal on Monday mornings - please mark these in your calendars too - I'll post reminders on Fridays.
