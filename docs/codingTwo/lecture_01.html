  <div>
    üëãüèª Hi! Welcome to Block Two! Well done on all successfully completing Block One! üéâ
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by looking at the homepage for Block 2: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/</a>. As you can see I'm going to be writing both Coding 2 and Product 2 as we go. So please say what you want to learn! I know you are all going to love SwiftUI on Fridays.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's move on by reviewing the README.md for Block Two on the Block Two GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024</a>. Don't forget to make note of the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024#block-2-assessment">assessment schedule</a> in your own calendars. As you know from Block One, assessment will be upon you before you know it! Tutorials will continue as normal on Monday mornings.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at the wiki for Block Two on the Block Two GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki">https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki</a>, paying particular attention to the reading list wiki page: <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki/Reading-List"></a>
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's move on to the text book that we'll be using to start this unit, the final book in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/higher-education/app-development/">Develop in Swift curriculum from Apple</a>, Develop in Swift Data Collections. As always, it's a good idea to get both the student and teacher editions. It's also a good idea to download both the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/data-collections/xcode13/student.zip">Student</a> and <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/data-collections/xcode13/teacher.zip">Teacher</a> materials.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's start with the student guide introduction, before moving on Unit 1: "Tables and Persistance". The first lesson is 1.1 "Protocols". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook and complete the playground lab before moving onto the review questions as a group.
  </div>
  <div>
    Next let's move onto lesson, 1.2 "App Anatomy and Life Cycle". Let's start with the Keynote, complete the exercise in the textbook before moving onto the review questions as a group.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue to the third lesson, 1.3 "Model-View-Controller". Let's start with the Keynote, review the textbook exercise and complete the "Favorite (sic) athletes" lab before moving onto the review questions as a group.
