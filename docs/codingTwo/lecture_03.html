    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10094/">"Explore game input in visionOS"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by watching this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10153/">"Dive deep into volumes and immersive spaces"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Let's continue by watching this video from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10102">"Compose interactive 3D content in Reality Composer Pro"</a>. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/composing-interactive-3d-content-with-realitykit-and-reality-composer-pro">source code for this session is available, let's take a look</a>. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/BOT-anist">The entire BOT-antist character selection app is also available</a> - if we have time, let's go through it, otherwise please look at the code and article as homework - as I'm keen to finish with the following two pieces of sample code that go into how gestures work on visionOS.

    Finally, let's look at these Sample Code articles from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-an-interactable-3d-model-in-visionos">"Creating an interactive 3D model in visionOS"</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/transforming-realitykit-entities-with-gestures">"Transforming RealityKit entities using gestures"</a>.
