    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by watching this session from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10100/">"Create enhanced spatial computing experiences with ARKit"</a>.</div>
  <div>Now let's go through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/building_local_experiences_with_room_tracking">the example code from that session</a>, let's get it building on all three Vision Pro's and then go through the code.</div>
  <div>Next, let's take a look at this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/introductory-visionos-samples">Introductory visionOS sample</a>: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/obscuring-virtual-items-in-a-scene-behind-real-world-items">"Obscuring virtual items in a scene behind real-world items"</a>.</div>
  <div>Next, let's take a look at this sample code: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/tracking-points-in-world-space">"Tracking specific points in world space"</a>.</div>
  <div>Next, let's take a look at this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/introductory-visionos-samples">Introductory visionOS sample</a>: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/applying-mesh-to-real-world-surroundings">"Applying mesh to real-world surroundings"</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's look at these two examples of using world tracking and head movement tracking:
    <ol>
      <ul><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/displaying-a-3d-object-that-moves-to-stay-in-a-person's-view">"Displaying an entity that follows a person’s view"</a></ul>
      <ul><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/placing-entities-using-head-and-device-transform">"Placing entities using head and device transform"</a></ul>
    </ol>
  </div>

    Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
