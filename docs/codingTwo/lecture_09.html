    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at this Sample Code article from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/simulating-particles-in-your-visionos-app">"Simulating particles in your visionOS app"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Stop press! Great comprehensive article from <a href="https://xreality.zone/en/post/unlocking-the-power-of-visionos-particles-a-detailed-tutorial/">XReality.zone: "Unlocking the Power of visionOS Particles: A Detailed Tutorial"</a>. Let's take a quick look - this is useful as a resource to refer back to later if you want to explore particles further.
  </div>
  <div>Another stop press! <a href="https://github.com/tokufxug/VisionOSParticleEmitterBurstSample/tree/main">ParticleEmitterBurstSample on GitHub</a> - let's try it!</div>
  <div>Next, let's take a look at this sample code: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/incorporating-real-world-surroundings-in-an-immersive-experience">"Incorporating real-world surroundings in an immersive experience"</a> - this combines physics simulation and world sensing.</div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at this Sample Code article from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/simulating-physics-with-collisions-in-your-visionos-app">"Simulating physics with collisions in your visionOS app"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's continue by looking at this Sample Code article from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/simulating-physics-joints-in-your-realitykit-app">"Simulating physics joints in your RealityKit app"</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Finally, <a href="https://stepinto.vision/?s=physics">Step Into Vision has loads of articles on physics</a> - pick one and get it running on the simulator and the Headset if we have time.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! As always, please review all today's content as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
