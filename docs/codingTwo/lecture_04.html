    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Today's lecture is going to be a deep dive into the visionOS sample code from Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/happybeam">Happy Beam</a>. Let's start by trying the app out amongst ourselves on one of our three Vision Pro headsets.</div>
  <div>Great, now that we've all experienced the app, let's take a look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/setting-up-access-to-arkit-data">this article which details how to set up access to ARKit data on device</a>. TLDR: you can add it to your project's app’s information property list or in code directly.</div>
  <div>Now that we've understood how to enable access, lets go through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/happybeam">Happy Beam</a> article and source code in detail. The way this app deals with the state of the game would be a great thing to duplicate in your Spatial 2 solo app - as well as its fantastic accessibility features - how many different ways does it allow you to play the game?</div>
  <div>Stop press! Lots of hand tracking demos from GitHub, shall we give them a try?
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Matt54/7581778f0a3f4f0da5bdcdf85db074f2">RealityView where users practice target shooting by detecting finger gun gestures and using ray casting to hit virtual targets</a>. Stop stop press! This code relies on the very useful <a href="https://github.com/XanderXu/HandVector">HandVector project</a> from <a href="https://github.com/XanderXu">Xander Xu</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Matt54/419aec30af60291b6e719e76f3d15e50">RealityView that detects finger gun gestures and uses ray casting to interact with virtual objects</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Matt54/5faee4bbbb935c334ebf8df7b44db28d">RealityView with raycasting from the index finger to a sphere, showing a color change on hit</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Matt54/ac4a9474fbfc6d266daffaab7f0fa677">RealityView of light beam synth with touch gesture interactions</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/Matt54/921cc3fb9ea2e8fae3681f9ff05e267a">RealityView where a cylinder's detected SpatialEventGesture modulates a signal generator's output</a>.</li>
    </ul>
