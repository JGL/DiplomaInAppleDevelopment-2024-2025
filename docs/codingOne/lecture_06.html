    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Optionals". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/optionalchaining">Optionals</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's continue with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Type Casting and Inspection". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/typecasting">Type Casting</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's continue with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Enumerations". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/enumerations">Enumerations</a>? What about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/nestedtypes">Nested Types</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's take a look at what the HIG says about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/layout/">Layout</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Together, let's continue Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials">Develop in Swift Tutorials</a> - moving onto: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/update-the-ui-with-state">Update the UI with state</a>, before finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/buttons-and-state-conclusion">Wrap-up: Buttons and state</a>.
