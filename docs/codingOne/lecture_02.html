    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>What is Swift? Let's look at the Swift homepage, which is at:<a href="https://www.swift.org">https://www.swift.org</a>.</div>
  <div>
    What does Apple say about Swift? Let's look at the Swift page on developer.apple.com: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">https://developer.apple.com/swift/</a>
  </div>
  <div>Apple's new approach to collecting all their videos, documentation and resources are known as Pathways. You can see all the Pathways at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/pathways/">https://developer.apple.com/pathways/</a>. Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/pathway/">Swift Pathway, at https://developer.apple.com/swift/pathway/</a>.</div>
  <div>Swift isn't just for making apps on Apple hardware, you can also use it to make <a href="https://thebrowser.company">cross platform web browsers</a>, <a href="https://vapor.codes">web applications</a> or <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/byte-sized-swift-tiny-games-playdate/">games</a> for the <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>.</div>
  <div>Time for a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/education/higher-education/app-development/">Develop in Swift curriculum</a>, "Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds".</div>
  <div>Another Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Constants, Variables and Data Types". What does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics">Constants, Variables and Data Types</a>? By the way, whenever I'm writing Swift, I find it REALLY useful to have <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/guidedtour">A Swift Tour</a> open in a browser window. I recommend you do the same.</div>
  <div>One more Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Operators". What does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/basicoperators">Operators</a>?</div>
  <div>What is SwiftUI? Let's see what <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">Apple says about SwiftUI</a>. What <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui">documentation</a> is available for SwiftUI? What does the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/pathways/swiftui/">SwiftUI Pathway</a> contain?</div>
  <div>Every year, Apple hosts a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference">World Wide Developers Conference</a> aka WWDC aka Dub Dub. It's the place where Apple debuts new technology that you (their developers) can use to make new software. Most sessions from WWDC are archived at: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/">https://developer.apple.com/videos/</a>. As well as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/pathways/">Pathways</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/education/higher-education/app-development/">Develop in Swift curriculum</a> we will be making extensive use of them over the next year. They are a really well produced free resource that you'll be able to reference this year and onwards in your developer career.</div>
