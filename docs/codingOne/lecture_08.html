    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Guard". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow/#Early-Exit">Guard</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's continue with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Fundamentals, "Scope".</div>
  <div>Let's continue with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Data Collections, "Protocols". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/protocols">Protocols</a>? What about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/adopting-common-protocols/">adopting common Protocols</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's watch another WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110353/">"Design protocol interfaces in Swift" (26 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can use Swift 5.7 to design advanced abstractions using protocols. We'll show you how to use existential types, explore how you can separate implementation from interface with opaque result types, and share the same-type requirements that can help you identify and guarantee relationships between concrete types."
    <br />
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch a WWDC video:
    <br />
    Have any of you heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a> before?
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110357/">"Meet Swift Regex" (23 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can process strings more effectively when you take advantage of Swift Regex. Come for concise literals but stay for Regex builders — a new, declarative approach to string processing. We'll also explore the Unicode models in String and share how Swift Regex can make Unicode-correct processing easy."
    <br />
  </div>
  <div>Homework:
    <ol>
      <li>Review today's content.</li>
      <li>Complete the two playgrounds from Develop in Swift Fundamentals: Lab - Guard.playground and Lab - Scope.playground and the single playground from Swift Data Collections: Lab - Protocols.playground. Don't forget completed versions can be found in the Teacher.zip download. Check the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/wiki/External-Resources#apple-textbooks">wiki</a> for download links.</li>
      <li>Slack me with any problems or queries. See you on Friday for the next Spatial lecture, the next ML lecture is first, on Thursday from 0930.</li>
    </ol>
