    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>I'll start by issuing the mock multiple choice test. I'll give you an hour for this, but you will get two hours in the real test next week.</div>
  <div>To finish, I'll issue the mock practical exam. I'll give you 90 minutes for this, so we've got some time to review afterwards. You'll have two hours the week after next.</div>
  <div>Let's practice submission - who knows how to make a zip file in macOS? Who knows how to name a file properly?</div>
  <div>Homework:
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare for your Block 1 assessment!</li>
      <li>Slack me with any problems or queries. See you on Friday for the next Spatial lecture, the next ML lecture is first, on Thursday from 0930.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
