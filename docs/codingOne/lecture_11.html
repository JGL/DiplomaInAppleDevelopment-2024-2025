    üëãüèª Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>To start, let's watch a WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10167/">"Meet SwiftData" (10 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "SwiftData is a powerful and expressive persistence framework built for Swift. We'll show you how you can model your data directly from Swift code, use SwiftData to work with your models, and integrate with SwiftUI."
    <br />
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch another WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10154">"Build an app with SwiftData" (19 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Discover how SwiftData can help you persist data in your app. Code along with us as we bring SwiftData to a multi-platform SwiftUI app. Learn how to convert existing model classes into SwiftData models, set up the environment, reflect model layer changes in UI, and build document-based applications backed by SwiftData storage."
    <br />
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch another WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10154">"Model your schema with SwiftData" (10 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how to use schema macros and migration plans with SwiftData to build more complex features for your app. We'll show you how to fine-tune your persistence with @Attribute and @Relationship options. Learn how to exclude properties from your data model with @Transient and migrate from one version of your schema to the next with ease."
    <br />
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch another WWDC video:
    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10196/">"Dive deeper into SwiftData" (16 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "Learn how you can harness the power of SwiftData in your app. Find out how ModelContext and ModelContainer work together to persist your app's data. We'll show you how to track and make your changes manually and use SwiftData at scale with FetchDescriptor, SortDescriptor, and enumerate."
    <br />
