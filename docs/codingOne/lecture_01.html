  </div>
  <div>
    First, are you all on the CCI Slack? If so, let's move on to confirming your attendance in this class! This will be your responsibility to do in every class that you attend. If you miss classes, you will be contacted by the CCI admin team. This is important not just for your learning, but most importantly for your welfare.
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Seats Mobile app from the iOS app store.</li>
      <li>Login with your UAL ID.</li>
      <li>Say yes to all the permission requests - notifications, Bluetooth (make sure it's turned on) and location.</li>
      <li>Then you should be able to simply check in.</li>
      <li>If you get stuck, message me on Slack for <a href="https://artslondon.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/CCI/Technical/EQM-3j0fmAZChArvPTezuLQBJEHO9eKyPTj2tnp6pe_FVw?e=hOPSDI">Student Guide</a> or <a href="https://ual.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c95aa6f4-39ef-45ef-96a9-af1b014550a2">a video guide</a>.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Next, let's go around the room and introduce ourselves, with how you like to be addressed, how you are feeling today and which BA you are on at UAL.</p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at the
      <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023/">Diploma homepage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023">GitHub readme.md</a> and finally the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023/wiki">GitHub wiki</a>.
      Please send me your GitHub ID's on Slack and I'll add you to the GitHub, so that you can edit your own introduction. Don't forget to find your Wu-Tang name! I'll demonstrate how to do that now.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    How to make use of the Disability services at CCI. You'll have already seen this on the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023">GitHub readme.md</a> Don't wait until to your Masters to get support like I did. Support is available - make use of it, you'll be glad you did. Our main contact for the Apple Diploma is Becky Keen: b.keen@arts.ac.uk</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    How to make use of the Library services at CCI. You'll have already seen this on the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023">GitHub readme.md</a> - but I just wanted to say that Benelia is amazing! Make use of the library - you'll be glad you did. She's provided <a href="https://artslondon-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/b_salmon_arts_ac_uk/ESTRp6SjjNNDgK-SDL8F-PkB8ImxrivphqOhusKH2B8YGQ?e=4%3AEzPwSX&at=9">an introduction presentation, let's go through it now.</a>
  </div>
  <div>
    How you can get support around the cost of living crisis - <a href="https://canvas.arts.ac.uk/News/203126/supporting-our-students-through-the-cost-of-living-crisis?goBackUrl=">the following article was recently posted by UAL management</a>. If you are finding it tough, financially, physically, mentally or psychically, please don't hesitate to get in contact with me directly or <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/students/student-services/student-advice-service">the UAL student advice service</a>. They are great. The sooner you ask, the more support we can give. Don't suffer in silence. London can be a lonely place. <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/fees-and-funding/scholarships-search/university-hardship-fund">The hardship fund is something I'd recommend applying to if you even think you might need extra support</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Are any of you interested in becoming the course rep? We must recruit two as by 11th October 2023! Who's interested? Slack me if you are - great for your CV. No voting, just volunteering.
  </div>
  <div>
    As a break, a presentation I gave recently on <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/presentations/TheFuture2022/">10 thoughts for the future</a>.
  </div>
  <div>My expectations of you through this year:
    <ul>
      <li>I expect you to be in person at CCI on the days that you have lectures - Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.</li>
      <li>Make use of the other resources here at CCI. The technicians, the researchers the other lecturers.</li>
      <li>I expect you to be checking the CCI Slack at least once every day (apart from weekends). Download the iOS Slack app. Right now if you haven't already.</li>
      <li>In terms of what you are going to make - by the end of this year I expect you to have created a pair of apps on the app store - one in a team, the other on your own. This will be real apps! I'm excited and I hope you are too.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Tutorials - every Monday morning. Tutorials are every <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023/wiki/Tutorial-Schedule">Monday morning from 1030-1300 on the CCI Slack</a>. They are 20 minutes long and can be about anything you like - the course, how you are, challenges you are having, ambitions, career advice, music selections. Whatever you like. I've got over 20 years of experience doing interesting things with computers</a>, so make use of that! Let's look at the schedule for next Monday and the one after.</div>
  <div>Important methods for succeeding on this course (and in general)</div>

  <div>What is the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute">Creative Computing Institute (CCI)</a>?</div>
  <div>What you are we going to learn in this next year?</div>
  <div>We are going to learn about Creative Computing - a blend of Computational Thinking and Creative Coding.</div>
  <div>What is Computational Thinking?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>To learn how see problems at many levels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a>), break down problems (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">decomposition</a>), find the order in them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>), make solutions using a series of steps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>) and realise that you might be able to use that solution in lots of areas (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization">generalisation</a>).</li>
      <li>Most of all, to <b>learn</b> how to be <b>autodidacts</b>.</li>
      <li>First task: <b>what</b> is an <b>autodidact</b>? </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Look it up! What did you find?</div>
  <div>What is Creative Coding?</div>
  <div>I believe all coding is creative, as all life is creative. Specifically, creative coding is about blending creative techniques with software engineering. I want you to learn how to write code but also how you could use computing to change your practice. You can make lots of earth credits writing software, but I'm much more interested in giving you the tools to change yourself, your practice and the world.</div>
  <div>Next, a really important diagram.</div>
  <div>
    <img src="images/JimCampbellFormula_for_computer_art.jpg" />
    <div><a href="https://jimcampbell.tv/">Jim Campbell</a>'s formula for Computer Art. Realise that you can use things without understanding every aspect of them. All that computers do is process inputs into outputs. That's it.</div>
  </div>
  <div>But what are we going to learn?</div>
  <div>
    <div>We are going to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>, which is <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#technology-top-paying-technologies">one of the most top paying programming languages in the world</a> as well as <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/app-store/developing-for-the-app-store/">audience of over 1.5 billion devices</a>. But it isn't about the money, it's about the impact. I want you to realise that your apps have just as much of a right to be on the home
      screen as anyone else's. Also, I have a feeling that the Apple Glasses are coming. You are all going to be in a superb position to make the first great apps for that device when it arrives.</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    Other coding resources:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/">The Stanford CS193p course on Developing Apps for iOS</a> is a great course exclusively in SwiftUI, the latest way of making apps for iOS - we'll be learning more of this later in the block, but you might want to get a head start!</li>

  <div>Some situating yourself in the world resources:</div>
  <div>
    We are in a stressful time at the moment. Here are some resources for situating yourself in the world, and how to keep going, set up a studio (if you want) and what you (maybe) should be doing:

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>What are we going to make?</div>
  <div>You are going to make two apps, a caring app in a group in Product One and a playful app on your own in Product Two (with help from me all along the way). You are also going to make your own ML model in ML Two. BTW, the idea of the playful and caring approach comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9S0HD8VH8">from this amazing presentation from David Graeber</a>. More about him in a moment.</div>
  <div>
    For inspiration for the things you can make on Apple platforms, let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/">Apple Design Awards 2023 winners and finalists</a>. Lots of behind the scenes articles at the bottom of that page too.
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>My aim is to have our final show in the Apple Headquarters in Battersea! I'm working on that as I speak. Would you like to see what students presented there last year?</p>
