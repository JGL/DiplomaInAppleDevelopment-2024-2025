    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    To start, let's continue Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials">Develop in Swift Tutorials</a> - moving onto: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-data-modeling">Welcome to data modeling</a>, before continuing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/model-data-with-custom-types">Model data with custom types</a> and finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/model-data-with-custom-types-conclusion">Wrap-up: Model data with custom types</a>.

    <br />
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10187/">"Meet SwiftData" (10 mins)</a>
    <br />
    "SwiftData is a powerful and expressive persistence framework built for Swift. We'll show you how you can model your data directly from Swift code, use SwiftData to work with your models, and integrate with SwiftUI."
