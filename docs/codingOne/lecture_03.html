    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with a Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Control Flow". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow/#Conditional-Statements">Conditional Statements</a>?</div>
  <div>As an aside, I'd like to explore debugging with you a little. First of all, what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a>? The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode">Xcode</a> section of developer.apple.com, has a section on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/debugging">debugging</a> - let's take a look at the article: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing-and-resolving-bugs-in-your-running-app">diagnosing and resolving bugs in your running app</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's continue with another Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Strings". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/stringsandcharacters">Strings and Characters</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's finish with another Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Functions". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions">Functions</a>?</div>
  <div>
    Together, let's start Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials">Develop in Swift Tutorials</a> - moving onto: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/hello-swiftui/">Hello, SwiftUI</a>, before finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/explore-xcode-conclusion">Wrap-up: Explore Xcode</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally, let's complete the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts">SwiftUI Concepts Tutorial: Learning SwiftUI</a>. Warning: this is a chicken and egg situation but we can do it together!
  </div>
  <div>Homework:
    <ol>
      <li>Review today's content.</li>
      <li>Complete the three playgrounds from today's lectures from Develop in Swift Fundamentals: Lab - Control Flow.playground, Lab - Strings.playground and Lab - Functions.playground. Don't forget completed versions can be found in the Teacher.zip download. Check the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/wiki/External-Resources#apple-textbooks">wiki</a> for download links.</li>
      <li>Slack me with any problems or queries. See you on Friday for the next Spatial lecture, the next ML lecture is first, on Thursday from 0930.</li>
    </ol>
