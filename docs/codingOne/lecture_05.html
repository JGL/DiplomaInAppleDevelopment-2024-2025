    👋🏻 Hi!
  </div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with a Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Collections". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/collectiontypes">Collection Types</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's continue with another Develop in Swift Fundamentals Keynote, "Loops". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow">Loops</a>?</div>
  <div>Let's finish with a Keynote from Develop in Swift Data Collections, "Closures". Once we've finished that, what does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures">Closures</a>? This is the end of a big chicken and egg moment - SwiftUI uses Closures everywhere!</div>
  <div>What does the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language">Swift Book</a> say about <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/subscripts">Subscripts</a>?</div>
  <div>
    Together, let's continue Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/welcome-to-develop-in-swift-tutorials">Develop in Swift Tutorials</a> - moving onto: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/design-an-interface/">Design an interface</a>, before finishing with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/layout-and-style-conclusion">Wrap-up: Layout and style</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's complete the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps/layingoutviews/">Sample Apps Tutorials: Laying Out Views</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Finally, lets review <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-layouts-with-stack-views/">this Apple Developer article on Building layouts with stack views</a>.</div>
  <div>Homework:
    <ol>
      <li>Review today's content.</li>
      <li>Complete the two playgrounds from today's lectures from Develop in Swift Fundamentals: Lab - Collections.playground and Lab - Loops.playground, as well as the playground from Develop in Swift Data Collections: Lab - Closures.playground. Don't forget completed versions can be found in the Teacher.zip download. Check the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-2024-2025/wiki/External-Resources#apple-textbooks">wiki</a> for download links.</li>
      <li>Slack me with any problems or queries. See you on Friday for the next Spatial lecture, the next ML lecture is first, on Thursday from 0930.</li>
