    👋🏻 Hi! I'm <a href="https://instagram.com/jgl">Joel</a>. My pronouns are he/him. I'm 44 and I live in London near Epping Forest with my fiancée Jess and cat Dave.

    Welcome to the Creative Computing Institute!
  </div>
  <div>
    Welcome to the Diploma in Apple Development 🍎👩🏻‍💻!
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this lecture, we'll have learnt about:
    <ul>
      <li>The lecturers on the Apple Diploma</li>
      <li>Who all of you are</li>
      <li>What people have made on this course before</li>
      <li>What you will make in the next year</li>
      <li>The key milestones of the year</li>
      <li>Some homework to complete before the first lecture, next Tuesday</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    There are two lecturers on the Apple Diploma, me and <a href="https://www.xiaowan-yi.com">Xiaowan-Yi</a>. She'll be teaching you all about Machine Learning. Let's go through <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com">my website</a> and <a href="https://www.xiaowan-yi.com">Xiaowan's</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves. Please say how you'd like to be addressed, what course you are coming from and what you are interested in making this year.
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's take a look at the results of the last two years of the Apple Diploma, from the end of year shows: <a href="https://vimeo.com/joelgethinlewis/applediploma2022-2023">2022/2023 cohort</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/joelgethinlewis/applediploma2023-2024">2023/2024 cohort</a>.
  </div>
  <div>
    What are you going to make this year? You are going to learn how to make apps for the Apple Vision Pro. How many of you have tried it? Have any of you ever done any programming? If so, in which language? Don't worry if you haven't, many people in previous cohorts started with no experience at all. Does anyone know the name of the coding language we will be learning this year?
  </div>
  <div>
    The key milestones of the year are the end of Block One and the end of Block Two. That's when we'll have assessment. The first half of the year will be all about making an app prototype in a group and the second half of the year will be all about making an app for release on your own. We'll have an end of year show with the rest of CCI and (hopefully) a presentation at the Apple UK headquarters at Battersea!
  </div>
  <div>
    What questions do you have for me?
  </div>
  <div>
    Some homework to complete before next Tuesday:

      <li>Sign up for a <a href="https://github.com/signup">free account on GitHub</a> - use a non UAL email so you can keep the account after you graduate.</li>
      <li>Find/<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108647">create your Apple ID</a>, so I can add you to our iOS development team at CCI. It's the same email that you use for your Apple TV or Music account.</li>
