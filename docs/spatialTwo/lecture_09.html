  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's begin by studying what goes into a visionOS icon:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines section on app icons</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/configuring-your-app-icon">Apple's Xcode article on "Configuring your app icon
          "</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.createwithswift.com/adapting-your-app-icon-to-visionos/">CreateWithSwift.com article on adapting your app icon for visionOS</a>. By the way, <a href="https://www.createwithswift.com/make-it-spatial/">CreateWithSwift.com has a whole series of great visionOS related articles</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's move onto <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/">TestFlight</a>. Let's watch this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/110343/">tech talk on "Get Started with TestFlight"</a>, followed by this WWDC23 video: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10012/">"Explore App Store Connect for spatial computing"</a>. Finally, let me show you the workflow that I use for making TestFlight apps for <a href="https://www.universaleverything.com">Universal Everything</a>. You must have a valid <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple Developer Program</a> membership for this. Do you?
  </div>
  <div>
    Let's get into anchor groups, I'll come round in turn. Next lecture I expect you to present revised project thoughts, including your third working app, demonstrating that you've uploaded to TestFlight successfully and created a valid three layer visionOS app icon.
  </div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLQUWyKv2-ee6ds7uxtFiZeO">"Design Specifics"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present your revised project thoughts next lecture, including your third working app, demonstrating that you've uploaded to TestFlight successfully and created a valid three layer visionOS app icon.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
