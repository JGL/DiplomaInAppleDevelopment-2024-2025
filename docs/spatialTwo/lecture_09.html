  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>

    Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present your revised project thoughts next lecture, including your third working app, demonstrating that you've uploaded to TestFlight successfully and created a valid three layer visionOS app icon.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
