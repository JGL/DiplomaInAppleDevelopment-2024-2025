  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by looking at the following WWDC23 presentation: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10034/">"Create accessible spatial experiences"</a> and follow up with this article: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/improving-accessibility-support-in-your-app">"Improving accessibility support in your visionOS app"</a></li>
  </div>
  <div>Let's split up into anchor groups, I'll go around them as usual.</div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLS1xisCnw_DpTg52sy7upu_">"Grab Bag"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present your final project in a dress rehearsal presentation next week. Perhaps you could add accessibility functionality as one of your next steps for your project?<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
