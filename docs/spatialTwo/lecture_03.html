  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, how did everyone feel about the homework? Any interesting insights?</div>
  <div>Let's watch this session from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10082/">"Meet ARKit for spatial computing"</a>.</div>
  <div>As mentioned in that session, you need to authorise your app to track hands and sense the world, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/setting-up-access-to-arkit-data">here is an article about how to do that</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's watch this session from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10100/">"Create enhanced spatial computing experiences with ARKit"</a>.</div>
  <div>Next, let's watch this session from WWDC24: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10104/">"Build a spatial drawing app with RealityKit"</a>. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/RealityKit/creating-a-spatial-drawing-app-with-realitykit">The complete source code for this app is available</a>, but I recommend starting with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/tracking-and-visualizing-hand-movement">this introductory visionOS sample: "Tracking and visualizing(sic) hand movement"</a>, before moving onto <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-a-painting-space-in-visionos">this introductory visionOS sample: "Creating a 3D painting space"</a>. This last one uses Metal, which we'll be looking at later in the Coding Two lectures. Metal is a low level library to do super optimised 3D and even ML on Apple platforms.</div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLSmJwGC258l2HhWgf-P877B">"Planning and Game Design"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>.</div>
  <div>Next lecture, you are going to present revised project thoughts, including a video paper prototype of your app. Let's spend time in our anchor groups, discussing paper prototypes and how you can document them. Don't forget you can use <a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a> to start building, or remix <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/introductory-visionos-samples">Apple's Introductory visionOS samples</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's finish by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-dPDsLTrTE">this presentation from Nintendo about the making of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework and prepare to present your revised project thoughts, including video paper prototype skateboards next lecture.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
