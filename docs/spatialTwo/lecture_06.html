  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with everyone showing their presentations your revised project thoughts, including your first working app, centred around your key moment.</div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLTwxbJjYoPyXUOik_ZiTxIE">"Marketing"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>.</div>
  <div>Welcome back, I'd like everyone to group themselves by anchor as before. I'll come to each group in turn.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
