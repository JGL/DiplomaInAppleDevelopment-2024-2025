  <div>Hi! 👻</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start with everyone showing their present your revised project thoughts, including your second working app, expanding around your key moment with sound.</div>
  <div>Has everyone got their projects up on GitHub? Send me URLs on Slack? I'd love to see? Would you like to see my workflow for GitHub? Don't forget this great YouTube playlist from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV">Daniel Shiffman: "Git and GitHub for Poets"</a>.</div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLTbEJdN9Rs6FWnOjlIj4Tdt">"Game Concepts"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>.</div>
  <div>Welcome back, I'd like everyone to group themselves by anchor as before. I'll come to each group in turn.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Please watch all of the content from today's lecture as homework.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
