  <div>Diploma in Apple Development üçéüë©üèª‚Äçüíª: Spatial Two: Lecture 1: Introduction to the Spatial Two unit.<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.</div>
  <div>Hi! üëª</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, let's review the solo playful apps that the Apple worms over last two years:

  <div>
    <iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/970545334?h=5c1d7cb4c1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <div>What are we going to be doing in Spatial Two? This time It's a solo brief around play (as defined in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9S0HD8VH8">David Graeber's talk: "From Managerial Feudalism to the Revolt of the Caring Classes"</a>).</div>
  <div>As mentioned on the wiki - you should be making use of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a> throughout the unit. You are going to have to make a 30 minute presentation at the end of this unit. Your aim should be to have a fully launched TestFlight app by the end of the Block. You <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases">should use TestFlight to release and test your app with select users</a>. I'm currently investigating how I can buy you all one year Developer Memberships! Please keep reminding me...</div>
  <div>To be clear, it's up to you to keep developing your individual app through the remainder of this unit - I'm going to be teaching you technologies that I think will be useful, but you should be asking me for support in tutorials when you need it. The aim is to be as close as possible to a real solo app developer practice.</div>
  <div>Keep it simple to start with! Get to a fully running game and then make it more complicated - skateboard, skateboard, skateboard! I'd rather see 15 amazing simple playful apps that make me smile and are fully launched than 15 broken prototypes.</div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLSHTbG4lQadRRtjzjARK69h">"Work Ethic"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>. Has anyone ever heard of him?</div>
  <div>Let's take a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games/pathway/">Apple Developer Games Pathway</a> and specifically the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-games/">Human Interface Guidelines for Designing for Games</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's watch this session from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10096/">"Build great games for spatial computing"</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's take a look at some games that are already out there for the Vision Pro:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.blackboxpuzzles.com">Blackbox</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZP4ZSsilC8&t=1s">For iOS</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LShA47LhIc">For visionOS</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://thrashergame.com">Thrasher</a>. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/story/id1773333874">Apple Vision Pro game of 2024!</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.orbitalknight.com/games/castle-crumble-vp">Castle Crumble</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxwulukvP5o">First play video on YouTube</a>.</li>
      <li>Apple have launched <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/apple-arcade-takes-players-into-a-new-dimension-with-spatial-gaming/">12 spatial titles via Apple Arcade</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/r2SpW1D8EIM?feature=shared">I found this 1.5 hour video of loads of visionOS games</a>...</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Next lecture we are going to start with everyone showing their 1 minute presentations on
    <ol>
      <li>Which ARKit anchor you are going to concentrate on for the rest of the year</li>
      <li>How the anchor relates to your BA or wider practice</li>
      <li>Your initial thought for a game to make</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    Which ARKit anchors are available? Have a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arkit-in-visionos">ARKit in visionOS homepage</a> for a complete list. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TLDR</a>: you must choose one of:
    <ul>
      <li>Hand anchors (hands will be the interaction method for all apps, but you want to augment hands specifically)</li>
      <li>Plane anchors or World anchors - building an experience that works with any floor, table or wall (pick vertical or horizontal) - being able to return to the same space and see the same virtual objects</li>
      <li>Image anchors - tracking flat images</li>
      <li>Object anchors - tracking 3D objects</li>
    </ul>
    Do any stand out to anyone already? Let's discuss.
  </div>
  <div>
    How the anchor relates to your BA or wider practice - if you are in graphic design, perhaps image anchors would be a good choice. If you are doing sculpture, then object anchors. If you can't decide, then go for hands or planes? Let's discuss.
  </div>
  <div>
    Your initial thought for a game to make - here are some thoughts I had while I was writing the lectures:
    <ul>
      <li>Game is to touch two 3D markers, then next marker and so on, fastest time wins? Almost like 3D Twister? Fastest wins? Smoothest wins?</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Traditional_toys">Traditional toys?</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Games_of_physical_skill">Games of Physical Skill</a>? E.g.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup-and-ball">Ball and cup</a></li>
      <li>Clapping? In a certain rhythm? Call and response?</li>
      <li>Magic finger jewellery?</li>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(card_game)">Snap</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_game">Other card games</a>?</li>
      <li>Battling <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/home">Warhammer miniatures</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiibo">Amiibo</a>?</li>
    </ul>
    Does anything stand out for you? Let's discuss.
  </div>
  <div>
    A reminder, next lecture you should come prepared with a 1 minute Keynote (must be Keynote!) presentation on:
    <ol>
      <li>Which ARKit anchor you are going to concentrate on for the rest of the year</li>
      <li>How the anchor relates to your BA or wider practice</li>
      <li>Your initial thought for a game to make</li>
    </ol>
