  <div>Hi! üëª</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Third, let's review the solo playful apps that the Apple worms over last two years:

    ADD OTHER VIDEO HERE
  </div>
  <div>What are we going to be doing in Spatial Two? This time It's a solo brief around play (as defined in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9S0HD8VH8">David Graeber's talk: "From Managerial Feudalism to the Revolt of the Caring Classes"</a>).</div>
  <div>As mentioned on the wiki - you should be making use of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a> throughout the unit. You are going to have to make a 30 minute presentation at the end of this unit. Your aim should be to have a fully launched TestFlight app by the end of the Block. You <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases">should use TestFlight to release and test your app with select users</a>. I'm currently investigating how I can buy you all one year Developer Memberships.</div>
  <div>To be clear, it's up to you to keep developing your individual app through the remainder of this unit - I'm going to be teaching you technologies that I think will be useful, but you should be asking me for support in tutorials when you need it. The aim is to be as close as possible to a real solo app developer practice.</div>
  <div>Keep it simple to start with! Get to a fully running game and then make it more complicated - skateboard, skateboard, skateboard! I'd rather see 15 amazing simple playful apps that make me smile and are fully launched than 15 broken prototypes.</div>
  <div>Great! Let's spend up to the next break watching videos from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgKCjZ2WsVLSHTbG4lQadRRtjzjARK69h">"Work Ethic"</a> category of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai's YouTube channel</a>. Has anyone ever heard of him?</div>
  <div>Next lecture we are going to start with everyone showing their 1 minute presentations on which ARKit anchor they are going to concentrate on for the rest of the year, how it fits into their practice and their initial thought. Have a look at the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/arkit-in-visionos">ARKit in visionOS homepage</a> for a complete list. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR">TLDR</a>: you must choose one of:
    <ul>
      <li>Hand anchors (hands will be the interaction method for all apps, but you want to augment hands specifically)</li>
      <li>Plane anchors - building an experience that works with any floor, table or wall (pick vertical or horizontal)</li>
      <li>Image anchors - tracking flat images</li>
      <li>Object anchors - tracking 3D objects</li>
      <li>World anchors - being able to return to the same space and see the same virtual objects</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Let's watch this session from WWDC23: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10096/">"Build great games for spatial computing"</a>.</div>
  <div>https://developer.apple.com/games/pathway/ this somewhere</div>
  <div>
    Chat about possible games - Game is to touch two 3d markers, then next marker and so on, fastest time wins?
    Or smoothest?
    Like 3d twister
    Old games? Medieval? Ball and cup
    Clapping?
    Or magic jewellery
    Or snap
    Or chess
