  <div>Hi! üëª</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, please welcome Oliver and Rebecca from Toad Bakery! Can you tell us the story of Toad please? What are you looking for in the apps that the students are going to make? What worked last year, what didn't?</div>
  <div>Third, let's review the solo playful apps that the Apple worms made last year:
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/853637709?h=cd74590421&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="AppShowcase2023"></iframe>
  </div>
  <div>Fourth, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>What are we going to be doing in Product Two? This time It's a solo brief around play (as defined in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9S0HD8VH8">David Graeber's talk: "From Managerial Feudalism to the Revolt of the Caring Classes"</a>) - making a playful app for the Toad Bakery in Camberwell. Let's take this opportunity to review the <a href="https://github.com/JGL/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/wiki/Reading-List#product-two-individual-app-design-and-launch">reading list for the unit on the Block Two wiki</a>.</div>
  <div>As mentioned on the wiki - you should be making use of the <a href="https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/appworkbook.key">App Design Workbook</a> throughout the unit. You are going to have to make a 30 minute presentation at the end of this unit. Your aim should be to have a fully launched app by the end of the Block, subject to approval by the Toad Bakery client. You <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing-your-app-for-beta-testing-and-releases">should use TestFlight to release and test your app with select users</a>. I'm currently investigating how to get you app store access via the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/university/">iOS Developer University Program</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's take another look at the homepage for Block 2: <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/">https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-SpringSummer2024/</a>. When is the first crit with Toad? What are you going to have ready to present then? I'd like to see a full app proposal, with a mockup in Keynote of the screens/views you are going to need to make.
  </div>
  <div>To be clear, it's up to you to keep developing your individual app through the remainder of this unit - I'm going to be teaching you technologies that I think will be useful, but you should be asking me for support in tutorials when you need it. The aim is to be as close as possible to a real solo app developer practice.</div>
  <div>What kind of playful apps? To start with you can draw on your learnings from Block One - from Swift Explorations and Swift Fundamentals - a personality test to decide what pastry you are, or instead of Rock, Paper, Scissors - Danish, Toad, Apple? Or sticker/social image app. I'm not just assessing you on the complexity of your playful app, but all the designing, testing and launching too.</div>
  <div>Keep it simple to start with! Get to a fully running game and then make it more complicated - skateboard, skateboard, skateboard! I'd rather see 5 amazing single screen apps that make me smile and are fully launched than 5 broken prototypes.</div>
  <div>We are going to start with SwiftUI and then move onto Augmented Reality technologies, before finishing with App distribution, unless there are requests for other technologies - have a think about this yourself! This is a good thing to talk about in our bi-weekly tutorials.</div>
  <div><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> is the latest API for creating User Interfaces in the Apple ecosystem.</div>
  <div>Let's throw ourselves in at the deep end, by completing the <a href="https://www.swift.org/getting-started/swiftui/">"Build an iOS app with SwiftUI" tutorial from Swift.org</a>.</div>
  <div>Next, we are going to go back to the start with <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds</a>, make sure you have it installed on your Mac.</div>
  <div>Next Playground: "Get Started with Code" - this is a basic one, so we can go through it quickly.</div>
  <div>Next Playground: "Learn to Code 1" - this is a basic one, so we can go through it quickly.</div>
  <div>Next Playground: "Learn to Code 2" - this is a basic one, so we can go through it quickly</div>
  <div>Next Playground: "Get Started with Apps".</div>
  <div>Next, let's try some of the official Apple SwiftUI tutorial series...</div>
  <div>Let's try <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts">"Learning SwiftUI"</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's try <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">"Introducing SwiftUI"</a>.</div>
  <div>Finally, let's review lots of the playground Apps we created, but making them in Xcode this time: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/sample-apps">"Exploring SwiftUI Sample Apps"</a>.</div>
