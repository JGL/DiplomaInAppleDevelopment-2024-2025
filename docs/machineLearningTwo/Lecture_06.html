       <br /> -- Neural Style Transfer : how does it work🤖          
       <br /> -- Neural Style Transfer with CreateML 🦈
</div>
  
   <div> Neural Style Transfer </div>
  
  <div> "Neural": it leverages deep learning technique (it uses neural networks for producing images) </div>
  
   <div> Style transfer🤔 </div>
  
   <div> Style transfer - level 1 understanding
  <br /> - Input: two images
  <br /> -- one is called "content image", the other one called "style image"
   <br /> - Output: one image
    <br /> -- an image that mirrors the content of the "content image" in the style of the "style image"
  </div>
  
 <div> Style transfer - level 2 understanding
  <br /> - How does a ST system produce the blended output from two input images? 
  <br /> -- Step 1. It initialises a random noise image like <a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/921d4cf0-f53a-4e5e-a7dc-7da0982b57d1/random_noise.jpg/:/rs=w:1280.">this </a>     
   <br /> -- Step 2. It gradually refine the noise image to be more similar to the "content image" in its content and more similar to the "style image" in its style.
  </div>
  
   <div> Style transfer - level 2 understanding
  <br /> - How does the refinement process work?
  <br /> -- It uses gradient descent to interatively update the pixel values in the initialized image, to minimise the content loss and style loss calculated.  
  </div>
  
   <div> Style transfer - level 3 understanding
  <br /> - What are the content loss and style loss? 
  <br />  (p.s. this is where the neural network comes into play!)
 </div>
  
     <div> Convolution neural network recap 👀
  <br /> - It extracts hierarchical features where the early layers extract low-level features like vertical lines, the deeper layers extract high-level features like more complex shapes.
  <br /> (<a href="https://swift-morning-print.glitch.me/#76">relevant slides from ML One </a>) 
 </div>
  
     <div> Style transfer - level 3 understanding
  <br /> - What are the content loss and style loss? 
  <br />  We'll use some pre-trained CNN to extract features of initialised image, content image, and style image at different levels and calculate their distances.
 </div>
  
     <div> Style transfer - level 3 understanding
  <br /> Content: Two images are similar in content if their high-level features as extracted by a pre-trained image recognition
system are similar.
 </div>
 
       <div> Style transfer - level 3 understanding
  <br />  Style: Two images are similar in style if their low-level features as extracted by a pre-trained image recognition
system share the same spatial statistics.
 </div>
  
     <div> Style transfer - level 3 understanding
  <br /> But what is "a pre-trained image recognition system"? 
  <br /> - We have seen a few already! 
  <br /> - Check out all the image classification models <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/">here</a>.

       <div> Style transfer - Summary
  <br /> How does it work?
  <br /> - We pick a pre-trained image classification model. 
  <br /> - We specify an input Content image and an input Style image.
   <br /> - The system initialises a random noise image.
 <br /> - The system computes the content and style losses between initialised image and input content images, based on the image classification model.
 <br /> - The system refines the initialised image iteratively using gradient descent to minimise the content and style losses.

CreateML time! 
  </div>  
  
    <div> 
your turn:
 <br /> 
--1. summon CreateML
 <br /> 
--2. select Style Transfer
<br /> 
--3. drop in your cool Training Style Image
<br />       
--4. drop in your cool Content Images
<br />    
--5. Train and see the result
<br />    
--6. Play with hyperparameters "Iterations", "Style Strength" and "Syle Density" (re-train and see the result!)

Maybe you'd like to have an IOS app running style transfer on camera input?

today we talked about:
  <br />  
-- Style transfer: what is it
     <br />  
--- input a content image and a style image, output a blended image
     <br />  
-- Style transfer: how does it work
     <br />  
--- Use pre-trained image classifier to compute content loss and style loss
     <br />  
--- Refine a randomly initialsed noise image via gradient descent for minimising the content and style losses
<br />  
-- Style transfer with CreateML, done easily 🫡
