  <br /> - Part 2: A presentation around a bespoke ML model.
  <br /> - start thinking about this "bespoke ML model" early!!! 
  <br /> - you can use your ML One presentation proposal as a starting point,
   <br /> - of course you can also build something new!
    <br /> - Make good use of CCI resources around, google, your peers, Mick and I 😎
    <br /> - We also have a fantastic AI and Data Science technician Mayra Berrones 😎

Let's start building the fruit classification model🍎🍏! 
  <br />We will be following this typical ML dev pipeline:
       <br />     1. DATA PREP     
  <br /> - - data collection
     <br /> - - data pre-processing
         <br />     2. MODEL TRAINING     
     <br /> - - train a model in CreateML (super simple)
     <br /> - - evaluate and improve
           <br />     3. DEPLOYMENT

  <div> step 1 data collection:  <a href="https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset"> fruit images dataset </a></div>
</div>
  
  
  
      <div>
     <br /> - <a href="https://github.com/red-x-silver/MLTwo-Lec01"> download this starter project</a> 
      <br /> - put it in a folder for ML Two stuff and unzip
       <br /> - open *ICDemo-working xcodeproj* 
           <br /> - NOT the ICDemo-starter
         <br /> - NOT the ICDemo-working mlproj

</div>
  
                <div>     
       Step 2 data pre-processing:
                  <br /> 
- that's just raw data(images scattered in folders), often times we need to preprocess the raw data to our needs!
  <br /> 
                - this part is usually done by coding in python, 
                  
                <br /> - but CreateML just makes our life easier 🤓
  </div>
  
              <div>     
Step 2.1 Summon CreateML 😈
    <br /> - open Xcode and select Xcode 
       <br /> → Open Developer Tool 
       <br /> - → Create ML from the drop-down menu  
</div>
  
  <div> 
   Step 2 data pre-processing:
     <br /> What data pre-processing do we need in this task? 
     <br /> - For supervised learning, we need data and their labels.
  <br /> 
=>
    <br /> 
- for image classification, we need images and their classes
    <br /> 
  =>
    <br /> 
- How does CreateML know the corresponding label for each image? 
  <br /> 

</div>
  
  
  
<div>     
🤗 Label info is inferred from file structure!
<br /> 
- this is also how we should prepare our img classification data (which is already done in this fruit classification example), when using CreateML
<br /> 
- Though when training in python, there are many other ways to feed in labels information...
</div>

  <div>
   Step 3 importing dataset into Create ML and training

</div>
  
  
          <div>     
Let's test the model trained with 25 iterations
</div>
  
            <div>     
How to check if a trained model performs well or not?
</div>
  
              <div>     
In CreateML, we can firstly look at the training/evaluation tab, 
   <br />             
where the higher accuracy the better
</div>
  
              <div>     
Secondly, thanks to CreateML, we can live preview the results using camera!
</div>
  
  
              <div>     
not working great 🫤
<br />
this is a good example of "you should not only looking at the accuracies,                
 <br />               
but also inputting images to the model and seeing the classification result yourself!"
                
</div>
 
    
<div>   
How to improve?
</div>
  
  
<div>   
Check out my model with 150 iterations and added noise & flips as data augmentation!
</div>
  
 
 <div>     
Let's bring this to our App!
 <br /> - 1. export the model
 <br /> - 2. drop the model file to the IOS App code.  
</div>
  
   <div>     
😎Done! Here is a summary of what we have done so far:
<br /> - 1. Collect a dataset of images of different classes.
<br /> - 2. Organise the images into folders with folder name being the class name. 
<br /> - 3. Open CreateML. 
<br /> - 4. Drag and drop the images into the data pool.
<br /> - 5. Select the hyper-parameters to your liking and hit training!    
<br /> - 6. Evaluate the results, adjust hyper-parameters, and train again!
<br /> - 7. Export the model and drop into the IOS App code.
