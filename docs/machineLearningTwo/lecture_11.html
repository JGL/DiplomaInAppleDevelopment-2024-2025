    <div>Welcome 👩‍🎤🧑‍🎤👨‍🎤</div>
   
        <div> 
        Today: 
       <br />
        1. A very gentle introduction to stable diffusion model.
      <br />    
        2. Play with different versions of stable diffusion models on Hugging Face.
      <br />
        3. Three routes (out of many) to have a stable diffusion model running on your MacBook.
  </div>
  

        <div> 
        Stable diffusion:
       <br />
       - It is a text-to-image generative model.
      <br />
       - It is a <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion">Latent Diffusion model</a> developed by researchers from the Machine Vision and Learning group at LMU Munich, a.k.a CompVis.
        <br />
      - Its model checkpoints (the actual model files) were publicly released at the end of August 2022 by a collaboration of Stability AI, CompVis, and Runway with support from EleutherAI and LAION. For more information, you can check out the <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release">official blog post</a>.     
  </div>
  
      <div> 
        Stable diffusion:
       <br />
       - Since its public release the community has done several iterations of modification/improvement 
    and there are different versions of stable diffusion models (<a href="https://replicate.com/guides/stable-diffusion/#the-models">version list here</a>).
      <br />
       - One common place to play with SD models is Hugging Face. They have computers storing the model files (quite large!) and running the actual computation for you. 
        <br />
      - You can play with stable diffusion v1-5 <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5">here</a>.
       <br />
      - Or you can play with stable diffusion v2-1 <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion">here</a>.
  </div>
  
        <div> 
🥲But sometimes their computers are busy and the queueing time can be long.
   <br /> What can we do?
    <br /> - Let's make stable diffusion models running locally on our machines and no queueing anymore yay!😎
  </div>

 
                <div>     
🌶️Easy mode:
       <br /> Download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/diffusers/id1666309574?mt=12">this APP</a> from APP Store and run.
       <br /> -- 🫱Your turn🫲!
</div>
  
                  <div>    
🌶️🌶️Normal mode:
       <br /> - The APP from previous slide is actually open-source.
       <br /> - We can download its source code from github <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/swift-coreml-diffusers">here</a> and build this xcode project!
     <br /> -- 🫱Your turn🫲!
                     <br /> -- Download the zip file from that Github repo (the green "Code" button), put it into your ML Two folder (or anywhere), and unzip.🤐 
                    <br /> -- On first launch, it will automatically download a zipped archive with a Core ML version of Stability AI's Stable Diffusion v2 base from <a href="https://huggingface.co/pcuenq/coreml-stable-diffusion-2-base/tree/main">here</a> and it can take 10-20 minutes.🫷🫸
                    <br /> -- Once the download finishes, it is ready to play!😈

  <div> What the app looks like running on Xiaowan's 2020 13-inch Macbook Pro M1, 16GB RAM, MacOS Ventura 13.6.1🧃</div>
</div>
  
<div>     
🌶️🌶️🌶️Hard mode:
       <br /> - The open-source project from last slide uses a ready-for-Apple (aka the nice CoreML version) stable diffusion model. 
       <br /> - The teams behind stable diffusion models primarily release the model in the PyTorch🔥 format (named "checkpoint").
        <br /> - To be able to run AI models natively in Apple ecosystem, we need the models in CoreML format (with an extension of ".mlmodelc").
</div>
  
  
  <div>     
🌶️🌶️🌶️Hard mode:
 <br /> - The previous two approaches save us from the process of converting the model from Pytorch checkpoints to CoreML format. 
      <br /> - You can also find a list of already converted model files <a href=" https://hf.co/apple">here</a> and use those model files in your app (like shown in <a href="https://github.com/ynagatomo/ImgGenSD2">this</a> project from GitHub). 
</div>
  
<div>     
🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️Warrior mode: 
       <br /> - What if we want to use a customized stable diffusion model like this <a href="https://huggingface.co/yehiaserag/anime-pencil-diffusion">anime pencil diffusion</a>✍️🎨 ? 
  <br /> - Sadly there is no converted-to-coreml models available 😥    
  <br /> - Let's just convert the model into CoreML format ourselves:
       <br /> -- We can convert the model following the official instructions <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion?tab=readme-ov-file#-converting-models-to-core-ml">here</a>.
      <br /> -- As the process may slightly vary from machine to machine, we will provide individual support on your tour - find a stable diffusion model that you like and we will help you with the model converting process using your machine.✋🤓🤚
