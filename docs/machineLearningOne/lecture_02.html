  <div> Recap </div>
  
  <div> 
   - Pattern recognition is everywhere and amazing. ⭐️
      <br />         
   - It'd be cool to better understand intelligence by prototyping it using human-made machine (“AI”).⭐️
      <br /> 
   - One intermediate goal of prototyping intelligence is to make machines to do pattern recognition. ⭐️
      <br />       
  (because we guess that pattern recognition is an essential part of intelligence.)       

  </div>
  
  <div> 
    from <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1251944">"Introduction to AI" by Mick Grierson</a>: 
    <br /> 
    - We can also view AI as statistical, probabilistic, stochastic and other mathematical processes that can be used to learn procedures and perform tasks automatically.
    <br />       
    - Symbolic and Connectionist approaches to AI  
    <br />

  <div> Representation </div>
  
  <div> What is apple </div>
  
  <div> Pattern recognition question 01
  <br /> 
  How do you distinguish apple as a fruit vs. Apple as a tech company? 
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Here are some possible representations:
  <br /> 
    - is it edible or not?
  <br /> 
    - is it a fruit?
   <br />
    - is the word spelled with an upper cased "A"? 🤪    
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Pattern recognition question 02
    <br />    
    How do you distinguish apple vs. pear?  🍎🍏🍐       
  </div>
      
  <div> 
    How do you distinguish apple vs. pear?  🍎🍏🍐
    <br />   
    Do any of our previous representations work?
    <br /> 
    - is it edible or not?
    <br /> 
    - is it a fruit?
    <br />
    - is the word spelled with an upper cased "A"? 🤪    
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    No but here are some possible representations:
    <br /> 
    - their shapes
    <br />
    - their tastes   
  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    Good representation simplifies our task!

  </div>
  
  <div> 
   Representation can be contextual.
   <br /> 
   Depends on the problem context, different tasks may have different efficient representations for the same objects.
  </div>
  
  
  <div> My take on representation:
     <br /> 
    - It can be descriptive and capture some characteristics.
     <br /> 
    - It can be perspective and partial. 
     <br /> 
    - It can be contextual where "good" ones are task-dependent.
  </div>

  <div> - A side note on abstraction (in the context of computational thinking) -
   <br /> 
   Abstraction is related to representation in the sense that    
   it is about taking away irrelevant details and reducing the representation to essential characteristics.
   <br /> 
   (Shoutout to  <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2022/codingOne/lecture_01.html#42">Joel's slides</a> on "what is computational thinking?")
  </div>
 
  <div> Speaking of representation... 
     <br /> 
    A name can be a person's representation and we have not heard about your names yet 😜

  <div> any questions so far? </div>
  
  <div> Numbers and Numeric representation </div>
  
  <div> 
     What do we use (real) numbers for?
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    - To count things
     <br />    
    - To measure things
      <br />   
    - To label things
      <br />   
    - ...

  <div> 
  A side note:
  <br /> 
  - Do we really have numbers in the real world? Have you seen numbers walking on the street on their own?
  </div>
  
  <div> 
  A side note:
  <br /> 
  Have you seen numbers walking on the street on their own?
  <br />
  - Numbers are often used with contexts. To connect numbers with reality, we always need interpretation guide(e.g. a protocol, unit, etc.) when using numbers in real life. 
  <br />
  - How to interpret numbers produced by computer programms is a helpful skill you can get from this unit.

  </div>
  
  <div> 
  Why are numbers important in this unit?
     <br />    
    - Our human-made poor machine can only deal with numbers 🫠
      <br />   
    - Numbers can introduce maths, which is our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmvkhLz8t7I">DOMAIN EXPANSION 💥</a>

    “Information era”🍎💻
     <br />    
    Information we receive from the world are mainly from four modalities:
      <br />   
    - Image (video)
      <br />   
    - Text (written language)
      <br />   
    - Audio (music, speech)
      <br />   
    - Number (the weather in degree celsius, your birthday, etc.  )
      <br />  
      Can you think of any information that is not from the four categories?
  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    My mind-blowing moment:
      <br />   
    - Information from any of those three categories (image, text and audio) can be digitized / numberified aka be represented by just a bunch of numbers.
  </div>
  
  <div> How to numberify the size of digital images?
     <br />  
    - Two numbers for its width and height (how many pixels).
    <br />  
    e.g. 3840 x 2160 for 4K resolution        
    <br />      
    - Sometimes another number for how many color channels there are.
   <br />      
    e.g. 256 x 256 x 3 for an RGB color image
  </div>

  <div>Here is one way to numberify digital images:
     <br />  
  - Three numbers for each pixel representing the RGB values in color images
     <br />     
  - One number for each pixel representing the greyscale value in grey images </div>
  </div>

  <div>Here is one way to numberify digital audio:
   <br />  
    - A series of numbers where each number denotes a displacement value from silence at that point of time </div>
  </div>
  
  <div> Here is one way to numberify text:
  <br />  
  - Think about when you are looking up a word in a dictionary📕 using page number and index
  <br /> 
  - To decode the pair of (page number, index) back to actual words, you will need to pass that dictionary around.
  <br /> 
  - OR?         
  <br />           
  - more on this in week11
  </div>
  
  
  <div> A tricky question for you!
   <br /> 
  How to numberify the label of an image being a dog🐶 image or a cat😼 image?
  <br /> 
  You are free to define any dictionary/protocol to explain the number(s) you have used.
  </div>
  
  <div> One possible way:
   <br /> 
  - I will use two numbers and each number is either 0 or 1.
   <br /> 
  - I will have the first number indicating if there is a dog in the image.
   <br />
  - And I will have the second number indicating if there is a cat in the image.
   <br />
  - If it is a dog-only image: [1, 0] (square brackets here are optional)
   <br />
  - If it is a cat-only image: [0, 1]
   <br />
  - If it is a dog and cat image: [1, 1]
   <br />
  - What does this numeric representation [0, 0] mean in this context?           
  </div>

  <div> Image classification </div>
  
  <div> What we will talk about today:
   <br />  
  - What is image classification? 
   <br />  
  - What can an image classification model do?
   <br />   
  What we will NOT talk about today:
   <br />   
  - How to make an image classification model from scratch?
   <br />   
  - How to modify an image classification model?         
  </div>
  
  <div> Image classification
   <br />  
  - It is a machine learning and computer vision task. 
   <br />  
  - It is a stepping stone task in computer vision and computational pattern recognition. 
   <br />  
  - The goal is to train a model to recognize and assign a predefined label or class to an input image. 
  </div>
  
  
   <div> Your first AI model to inspect!!! </div>
  
   <div> One hack for inspecting any model: 
    <br /> 
    Because a model is about "input -> process -> output",
    <br /> 
    to inspect what a model does, one helpful starting point is to check its input and output!
   </div>
  
  
   <div> Input? Output? </div>
  
  
   <div> Image classification model:
     <br /> 
    - Input: a digital image
    <br /> 
    - output: the predicted classes of the input image 
   </div>
    
   <div> Image classification model:
     <br /> 
   Input (in a bit more details):
    <br /> 
   An image with a pre-defined size.
    <br /> 
   (but you can get around with the size limit simply by resizing and/or cropping images.)
    <br /> 
   (and be careful of the aspect ratio!)
   </div>
  
   <div> Image classification model:
     <br /> 
     Output (in a bit more details):
     <br /> 
     Probabilities assigned to each class from a set of pre-defined classes.
   </div>
  
   <div> 
      Image classification model:
      <br /> 
      It outputs probabilities assigned to each class from a set of pre-defined classes.
      <br /> 
      Let's dive into the "pre-defined classes" bit 
  </div>
  
   <div> Back to the example of dog🐶-or-cat😼 image classification model:
     <br />
       What are the pre-defined classes that this model can predict into?
     <br />
       - a class for "dog" and a class for "cat"
     <br />
       - Can this model tell us which vehicle the input image is?
     <br />
       - 🚫
     <br />
       - But it would be interesting to feed a 🚗 image into the model and see how it improvises.
   </div>
  
   <div> 
      Image classification model:
      <br /> 
      It outputs probabilities assigned to each class from a set of pre-defined classes.
      <br /> 
      Let's dive into the "probabilities" bit 
  </div>
  
  <div> - It is primarily outputing a list of probabilities assigned to each class from the pre-defined class sets 
   <br /> 
    - From there, we can easily post-process the list of probabilities and output human-friendlier result like "which one is the most probable class?"
  </div>
    
  <div> any questions so far? </div>
  
  <div> Takeaway messages from our first encounter with image classification models
   <br />  
  - Each model has a pre-defined input image size.
    <br />  
  - Each model has a pre-defined output classes range.
  </div>
  
  
   <div> A toy example on image classification in playground </div>
  
   <div> Has everyone installed Xcode? </div>
  
   <div> Download the playground <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1251946">here</a> and double click the file to open it (Xcode should be fired up automatically)</div> 
  
   <div> 
     Don't panic about the chunks of swift code 💙
     <br />
     - The code has been prepared and is ready to run.
     <br />
     - It can predict the given input image's class, one image at a time.
  </div>
  
  <div> 
      All we have to do for this lecture is to:
      <br /> 1. Run the playground as it is.
      <br /> 2. Check the classfication results.
      <br /> 3. Inspect the loaded classification model's input image size and output classes.
      <br /> 4. Swap to another input image and run the playground.

  <div> Today we have talked about:
     <br />
     Representation 🧠
       <br /> - descriptive, perspective, and contextual
       <br />
     Numeric representation 🌶️
       <br /> - How image, audio and text can be represented by numbers
       <br />
      Image classification 🕹️
       <br /> - Given an input image, which is of a pre-defined size, a IC model predicts the probabilities of that image assigned to each class from a pre-defined set of classes.
  </div>
  
  
  <div> Homework :)
       <br />
       Envision an App that leverages image classification model(s) 👐
       <br /> Some possible starting points:
       <br /> - What is the scenario where an image classification model could be helpful / fun?
       <br /> - What are the classes you envision the model to predict from input images?
       <br /> - Classes could be any, both objective and subjective(e.g. different emotions) categories!
