  <div>
    Today we are going to see how to multiply things together, which is a significant part of what AI models are doing
    :)
  </div>

  <div> 1. Multiply a vector/matrix with a scalar

    <br /> - Multiply every element in the vector/matrix with the scalar

    <br /> - that's why it gets the name "scalar"

  </div>

  <div> 1. Multiply a vector/matrix with a scalar

    <br /> - Let's move to the <a
      href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fI343lknGVtvOKBqtz1HMHE-Ug2EtwSe?usp=sharing">colab notebok</a>.
    <br /> - Scroll down to "Multiply matrices with a scalar"

  </div>


  <div> 1. Multiply a vector/matrix with a scalar

    <br /> - Multiply every element in the vector/matrix with the scalar

    <br /> - 🌶️ does the shape of the vector/matrix change after scalar multiplication?

  </div>

  <div> 1. Multiply a vector/matrix with a scalar

    <br /> - Multiply every element in the vector/matrix with the scalar

    <br /> - 🌶️ does the shape (dimensionaltiy) of the vector/matrix change after scalar multiplication?

    <br /> - Nope, the shape does not change. The numebr of rows and number of columns stay the same.

  </div>

  <div> 2. Multiply two vectors

    <br /> - There are several types of vector multiplication and each one has a different computation rule.

    <br /> - 🌶️🌶️ In this unit we are only going to talk about one of them --


    <br /> -- "dot product"

  </div>


  <div> 2.1 Dot product (inner product)

    <br /> - Despite the strange name, it is a simple computation rule.

    <br /> - with some profound implication! (we'll see later)

  </div>

  <div> 2.1 Dot product (inner product)

    <br /> Let's move to the <a
      href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fI343lknGVtvOKBqtz1HMHE-Ug2EtwSe?usp=sharing">colab notebok</a>.

    <br /> - Scroll down to "Multiply two vectors using dot product"

  </div>



  <div> 2.1 Dot product (inner product)

    <br /> - Despite the strange name, it is a simple computation rule.

    <br /> - 🌶️🌶️ What is the shape of the dot product between two vectors?

  </div>

  <div> 2.1 Dot product (inner product)

    <br /> - Despite the strange name, it is yet another simple computation rule.

    <br /> - 🌶️🌶️ What is the shape of the dot product between two vectors?
    <br /> - 🌶️🌶️ A single number - scalar!

  </div>






  <div> 3. Multiply a matrix with a matrix

    <br /> - Let's move to the <a
      href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fI343lknGVtvOKBqtz1HMHE-Ug2EtwSe?usp=sharing">colab notebok</a>.
    <br /> - Scroll down to "Multiply two matrices"

    <br /> - 🌶️🌶️ There is a shape rule.

  <div>
    Next, we are going to:
    <br />
    - take a look at more simple python basics!

  </div>

  <div>
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fI343lknGVtvOKBqtz1HMHE-Ug2EtwSe?usp=sharing"> A prepared google
      colab notebook </a>
    <br /> 1. click on the link and open this google colab notebook
  </div>




  <div>
    Let's take a look at the notebook!
    <br />

    <br /> - 1. Make sure you have saved a copy to your GDrive or opened in playground. 🎉
    <br /> - 2. Read all text cells and code cells in Conditionals, Loops and Functions.
    <br /> - 3. Try the first excercise (Excercise 1.).

  </div>



  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>


  <div> Today we have looked at:

    <br />
    Scalar, vector and matrix 🧑‍🎨
    <br />
    - how to multiply with a scalar
    <br />
    -- how to take dot product between two vectors
    <br />
    -- how to multiply two matrices (the shape rule)

    <br />
    -- Dots will be connected in the future lecture! (You will see that matrices and their addition/multiplication are
    actually the building blocks of AI models as well as many other cool stuff.)

  </div>


  <div>
    We'll see you next Thursday same time and same place!
