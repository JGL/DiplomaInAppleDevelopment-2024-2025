    <br /> *Tips for presentation (ML One assessment)*


  </div>

  <div> First of all, don't forget to confirm your attendence on <a
      href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2023/codingOne/lecture_01.html#6"> Seats App!
    </a></div>

  <div> as usual, a fun AI application Music Source Separation (with <a href="https://www.lalal.ai/">LALAL.AI</a> as an
    example) to wake us up
  </div>


  <div> - Neural networks for modelling sequential data -
    <br /> (following content is adapted from <a
      href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=1251960">Mick's slides</a>)
  </div>

  <div> 〰️ Introduction to sequential data - what's a sequence? 〰️

    <br /> - A tracking record of coin tosses 🪙
    <br />- A transcript/score of a drum beat 🎼🥁
    <br />- An audio recording of a drum beat 🎤🥁
    <br />- Letters in a word
    <br />- Words in a sentence
    <br />- Methods in a cooking recipe🔖

    <br />- Numbers in a list of any kind that represent anything that happens over time 💯

  </div>

  <div> 〰️ Introduction to sequential data - sequence of tokens 〰️

    <br /> Let's use "token" to denote the "what" in any sequence.
    <br />- A transcript/score of a drum beat 🎼🥁: each music note as token
    <br />- An audio recording of a drum beat 🎤🥁: each audio sample as token
    <br />- Letters in a word: each letter as token
    <br /> Words in a sentence: each word as token
    <br />- Methods in a cooking recipe🔖:each method as token

  </div>

  <div> 〰️ Introduction to sequential data - token embeddings 〰️
    <br /> 🫲What token really is if we want to feed sequence data into our computer for doing some computation later?🫱
    <br /> - They are just representations (of note, audio sample, letter, word, etc.) in numbers, which are just
    vectors/matrices.
  </div>


  <div> 〰️ Introduction to sequential data - sequential data modelling tasks 〰️

    <br /> 🫲Say we are given this sequence dataset, which comprises a list of token embeddings where the order implies
    the time dimension🫱
    <br />What tasks can we do? What information can we model and predict?
    <br />- 1. At any point of time, based on what has happened, which token is likely to the next?
    <br />-- example application: langauge modelling -> given a context of previous text, predict the next word (this is
    what ChatGPT does)
  </div>

  <div> 〰️ Introduction to sequential data - sequential data modelling tasks 〰️

    <br />- 2. At the end of the sequence, based on what has happened in the entire sequence, what kind of sequence is
    this?
    <br />-- example application: sentiment analysis
  </div>

  <div> 〰️ Introduction to sequential data - sequential data modelling tasks 〰️

    <br />- 3. At the end of the sequence, based on what has happened in the entire sequence, can we predict another
    related sequence?
    <br /> -- example application: machine translation -> given a sentence in French, generate the English version of it
  </div>

  <div> Models that are made for sequential data modelling: RNN and LSTM

    <br /> <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">A very good introduction here.</a>
  </div>

  <div> RNN - summary

    <br /> 1. Recurrent Neural Networks are different from MLPs, CNNs etc.
    <br /> 2. They still have input layer, hidden layers with weights and biases.
    <br /> 3. The hidden layers are applied recurrently along tokens of an input sequence - RNNs have loops in them! (
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Recurrent-Neural-Network-with-loop_fig3_321453109">Here</a> is an
    illustration.)
    <br /> 4. The network doesn't hard memorise an exact copy of the sequence. Instead it encodes the compound
    information of tokens in a sequence.
    <br /> 5. This architecture has a kind of'memory'.
  </div>

  <div> <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-i7paU37t8nouB2ANOkuZw0RaMYoLjVo?usp=sharing">A google colab
      notebook for training an RNN to generate text</a> (using <a
      href="https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn/tree/master/data/tinyshakespeare">text from Shakespear</a> as training
    data) </div>


  <div> RNN - the problem🥲

    <br /> - It is designed to "try to memorise everything from a sequence".
    <br /> - Because of that recurrent loop, which can be unrolled into a looong computation graph, RNN suffers from
    exploding/vanishing gradient.
    <br /> (meaning that it is hard to train a RNN, and to have a good modelling performance)

  </div>



  <div> RNN - the mitigation🤗 -> LSTM

    <br /> Other RNN variants are proposed for better optimization performance.
    <br /> - LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Networks, I usually refer to <a
      href="https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">this article</a> for an in-depth explanation.)
    <br />- LSTM networks add gates (yet another sets of weight and bias and activation function) to edit and filter the
    information that the RNN retains.
    <br />- These gates allow for "selectively forgetting information" in a way.

  <div> Introduction to natural language processing🗣️

    <br /> - It's about language!
    <br />- Our language, either written(text) or spoken(audio) is in the form of sequential data!

  </div>


  <div> Introduction to natural language processing🗣️

    <br /> Natural language processing, or NLP, combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language
    with statistical and machine learning models
    <br />- to enable computers and digital devices
    <br />- to recognize, understand and generate text and speech.

    <br />- Check <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing#NLP+use+cases">here</a> for example
    applications of NLP (we have seen some of them already🤗)

  </div>


  <div> What does GPT in ChatGPT stand for?

    <br /> - Generative Pre-trained Transformer.
    <br /> Transformer is the neural network that does the heavy lifting behind ChatGPT.

  </div>

  <div> Transformer

    <br /> You can find the original epic-titled paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">here</a>, and many
    good explanations online.
    <br /> ‼️"Attention mechanism" is the key design.
    <br /> - Key components:
    <br /> -- Transformer block with self-attention layer, feedforward layer, residual connection and layer
    normalization

  </div>

  <div> Transformer

    <br /> - We use language tokens as input to transformer for NLP tasks.
    <br /> - Transformer is quite universitile and can be applied to other domains and data modalities.
    <br /> - It can be very powerful for multi-modal application. 💪
    <br /> *You just need to swap that language token to be other tokens, for instance, patches from an image, latent
    code from an audio etc. *
    <br /> - An example: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">Vision Transformer (ViT)</a>
    <br /> - Hugging face has a <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index">model hub</a> for Transformers.
