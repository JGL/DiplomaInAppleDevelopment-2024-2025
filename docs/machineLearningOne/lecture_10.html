  <div> Recap</div>

  <div> 🍰Convolutional neural network (CNN) is better at image tasks than MLP: efficient and effective. </div>
  <div> 🤘CNN is characterised by two new types of layers: conv layer and pooling layer </div>
  <div> A conv layer has a set of filters and is convoluted with previous layer's activations. 🔎 </div>
  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>
    <img src='https://cdn.glitch.global/a5d78b38-91c6-4583-82da-75eb6dad2022/conv.webp?v=1670549167473' />
    <div>Convolution is actually quite easy:
      <br /> - "filter" in the image is the weights matrix
      <br /> - element-wise multiplication between input and filter matrices
      <br /> - sum up the element-wise products to one number, similar to dot product
    </div>
  </div>

  <div> A pooling layer takes the avg/max value within each sliding window on previous layer's activations. ◰ </div>
  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>
    <img src='https://cdn.glitch.global/a5d78b38-91c6-4583-82da-75eb6dad2022/maxpooling.png?v=1670553224802' />
    <div> max pooling is just another easy math operation, it reduces each dimension by half in this example </div>
  </div>

  <div> A conv block is a stack of one or more conv layers followed by a pooling layer. 🍔 </div>
  <div> A typical CNN: input layer -> conv blocks -> fc layer -> output layer 🍔🍔 </div>

  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>

    <div> A state-of-the-art AI model: PoseNet.
      <br /> - Intimidating maybe at the first look
      <br /> - By looking closely you will find it is just many good old layers stacking together.
    </div>
  </div>

    <div> Intuition on how CNN works: it hierachically extracts features from an image: from simple edges to complex
      patterns </div>
  </div>

  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>

  <div> end of recap 👋 </div>



  <div>
    Now that we have the basics (CNN) equiped, let's have a bird eye view on computer vision!
  </div>

  <div>
    What is computer vision?
  </div>

  <div>
    Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to <strong>derive
      meaningful information</strong> from digital images, videos and other visual inputs.
  </div>

  <div>
    Meaningful information from digital images:
    <br> - What is it about?
    <br> - What are the objects in it?
    <br> - Where are the objects in it?
    <br> etc.
  </div>

  <div>
    🤠Here are several main CV tasks:
    <br> - Image classification
    <br> - Object detection
    <br> - Image segmentation
    <br> - Scene reconstruction
    <br> etc.
  </div>

  <div>
    🏋️While they all take digital images as input, we can differentiate these CV tasks by their distinct output types:
    <br> - Image classification: outputs a categorical vector
    <br> - Object detection: outputs bounding boxes
    <br> - Image segmentation: outputs pixel masks (providing finer object location precision than bb )
    <br> - Scene reconstruction: outputs 3D representations
  </div>

  <div>
    let's look at some of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/models/">apple models</a> and
    corresponding tasks, now this page should be much more familiar
  </div>

  <div> The evolution of AI models in computer vision (story time): </div>

  <div> Once upon a time... </div>

  <div> The story started with two scientists and a cat🐈 in the 1950s-1960s.</div>

  <div>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOHayh06LJ4">Hubel and Wiesel Cat Experiment</a>:
    <br /> They discovered that the early layers of cat's visual cortex responded to simple shapes, like hard edges or
    lines.
    <br /> - This meant that image processing starts with simple shapes like straight edges
    <br /> (here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw5PKV9Rj3o">demo</a> of the experiment.)
  </div>

  <div> In the 1960s, AI emerged as an academic field of study, and it also marked the beginning of the AI quest to
    solve the human vision problem. </div>

  <div> 1974 saw the introduction of optical character recognition (OCR) technology, which could recognize text printed
    in any font or typeface.

    <br /> - (check out <a href="  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU8A80Y5NQU">Optacon</a>)
  </div>

  <div> In 1982, neuroscientist David Marr established that vision works hierarchically and introduced algorithms for
    machines to detect edges, corners, curves and similar basic shapes. </div>

  <div> Concurrently, computer scientist Kunihiko Fukushima developed a network of cells that could recognize patterns.
    The network, called the <a href=" https://www.rctn.org/bruno/public/papers/Fukushima1980.pdf">Neocognitron</a>,
    included convolutional layers in a neural network.
    <br /> - Neocognitron was applied to Japanese handwritten character recognition and other pattern recognition tasks.
  </div>

  <div>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50u3LfmgDKU">Back to the year of 1998 </a>
  </div>

  <div> "hello world" dataset of machine learning - MNIST, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database#/media/File:MnistExamples.png">handwritten digits images with
      labels </a> </div>



  <div> Lenet: one of the earlies Convolutional Neural Network, with conv and pooling layers, the prototype of
    everything follows </div>


  <div>
    But what next? Where should computer vision go? In the early 2000s, computer vision tasks included face recognition,
    matching satellite images, image stitching, 3D scene reconstruction ...
  </div>

  <div>
    Finding the focal point, the right level of difficulty and task abstraction: obejct recognition
  </div>

    </a>
  </div>

  <div>
    It has an annotated <a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/databases.html#VOC2005_1"> dataset </a>
    <br />
    number of training images: 1500±
    <br />
    image dimension: RGB 450*280 ish
    <br />

    four classes: motorbikes, bicycles, people, and cars
    <br />
    type of tasks: let's have a look!
  </div>

  <div>
    🍜 noodle time!
    <br />
    How would you programme the computer to differentiate a car from a bike? (a car-or-bike binary classifier)
  </div>

    <br />
    How would you programme the computer to differentiate a car from a bike? (a car-or-bike binary classifier)
    <br />
    Rule-based explicit programm is hard...
  </div>
  <div>
    Type of tasks:
    <br />
    classification: outputs categorical vector
    <br />
    obejct bouding box detection: outputs bounding box
    <br />
    object segmentation: outputs pixel mask
    <br />
    These are the milestone tasks for computer vision till today.
  </div>

  <div>
    While "gathering data" nowadays is just an everyday word, back at 2005 there was not so much mindset about the
    "data" and the impact of just the scale of data!

  </div>

  <div>
    Let's move on to the ImageNet era 👽
  </div>

  <div>
    The visionary ImageNet was introduced in 2010.
  </div>

  <div>
    Let's take a look at its visionary scale:
    <br />
    number of training images: 1,281,167
    <br />
    image dimension: RGB 469x387 on average
    <br />
    <a href="https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/">1000 classes</a>: based on WordNet

    <br />
    tasks: image classification and object detection
    <br />

  </div>

  <div>
    and introducing another scientist behind recent computer vision developments <a
      href="https://youtu.be/Z7naK1uq1F8?t=2">Feifei Li</a>
  </div>

  <div>
    another visionary design of ImageNet: 1000 classes from WordNet
    <br />
    WordNet consists of many English-language terms organized into an ontological structure
  </div>

  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-columns: 1fr;grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>

' />
    <div>Wordnet example: a lexical database that is ontologically structured</div>
  </div>


  <div>
    It is bridging computer vision with cognitive science and 1000-class classification task is far beyond the
    capability of contemporary models
  </div>

    Explanation of "top-5" error on whiteboard
  </div>



  <div>
    - 1. It was really bad in 2010 and 2011
    <br /> - 2. Everything changed from 2012, from AlexNet onwards
  </div>


  <div>
    <br /> - From AlexNet in 2012, we saw an explosion of AI models in CV.
    <br /> - Let's take a look at some of the big namers (they are all image classifiers initially trained on ImageNet
    dataset).
  </div>


  <div>
    Side note:
    <br />
    every big name model is usually chracterised by one or few brilliant architectural designs (e.g. a new set of
    hyper-paremters, a new layer type etc.).

  </div>

  <div>
    <a
      href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/types-of-convolutional-neural-networks-lenet-alexnet-vgg-16-net-resnet-and-inception-net-759e5f197580">
      just for reference</a>
  </div>

  <div>
    AlexNet: the first CNN that goes "deep", and uses GPU for training
  </div>

  <div>
    VGG: deeper(aka it has more layers), with smaller filter size(3x3) in conv layers
  </div>

  <div>
    Resnet: residual modules ("new layer type"), connections jumping layers
  </div>

  <div>
    Inception, or GoogleNet: inception modules ("new layer type"), it goes "wide"
  </div>

  <div>
    All these models pre-trained on ImageNet can be used as a good starting point for "any" vision task.
    <br />
    - think of these models as "vision task bootcamp" graduates,
    <br />
    they are good visual feature extractors.
    <br />
    We'll see applications of these next semester!
  </div>

  <div>
    "New" topics of computer vision:
    <br />
    - Image captioning (image to text) e.g. models <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS">here</a>
    <br />
    - 2D images generation: GAN( <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">thispersondoesnotexist</a>), Stable
    diffusion (next year😈)
    <br />
    3D models generation:
    <br />
    -- 2D-to-3D, e.g. avatar generation with <a href="https://youtu.be/1Lkk7PHbE8E?si=5cff8kusdNla4T3I">RODIN by
      Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/rSb0Io92_R8?si=0bdBYhAZtmKTLT_r">Avaturn</a>(it has a free plan)
    <br />
    -- text-to-3D, e.g. game asset genetation <a href="https://youtu.be/O1TlGOmSQ4M?si=X05VaM49SVJCG1xj">Masterpiece
      X</a>
  </div>


  <div>
