    Scalar, vector and matrix 🧑‍🎨
    <br />
    - how to multiply two matrices?
    <br />
    -- the shape rule:
    <br />
    -- the shapes of the two matrices should be: M x K and K x N
    <br />
    -- the shape of the product matrix would be: M x N

  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>




  <div> Another building block before we diving into AI neural networks next week: </div>

  <div> Functions </div>

  <div> What is a function in maths:

    <br />
    A function relates an input (usually a number) to an output (usually a number).
  </div>

  <div>What are the keywords there? Do these sound familiar?</div>

  <div>
    Where else can you find this construct of "input, process, output"?
  </div>

  <div>
    Where else can you find this construct of "input, process, output"?
    <br />
    - Models!
  </div>

  <div>
    ☕️ sit back and watch
    <a href="https://youtu.be/X5fD0Evny4w">this geeky vid from 5 years ago
    </a>
  </div>

  <div> Most of the time models (like the AI model we are about to see next week) can be seen as a set of functions
    wired up together. </div>

  <div>Some conventions on function expression</div>

  <div>
    function input: x
    <br />
    function output: f(x)
    <br />
    f(x) = x + 1
  </div>

  <div> Most of the time we can use tables to describe a function.
    <br />
    (on whiteboard)
  </div>

  <div> Most of the time we can also use graphs to represent a function.
    <br />
    (on whiteboard)
  </div>

  <div> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvGsIo1TmsM">This</a> video explains functions short and simple. </div>

  <div> Big namer functions (especially in AI) </div>

  <div>Jargons alert but don't be afraid they are cute</div>

  <div>
    exponential
    <br />
    sigmoid
    <br />
    quadratic
    <br />
    relu
    <br />
    sine
    <br />
    tanh
  </div>

  <div>
    Let's google their function graphs one by one and draw on the whiteboard!
    <br />
    - exponential
    <br />
    - sigmoid
    <br />
    - quadratic
    <br />
    - relu
    <br />
    - sine
    <br />
    - tanh
  </div>

  <div>Note that we are not expected to memorise the math equations for each function.
    <br />
    Just knowing the shape of their graphs is sufficient.
  </div>

  <div>Fun stuff: different "personalities" of functions</div>

  <div>
    - asymptotic (quite philosophical, it touches the notion of infinity)
    <br />
    - squashing anything to be between 0 and 1 (remember probability?😉)
    <br />
    - symmetric (things can go equally wrong in different directions ...)
    <br />
    - ignoring negative(booo) numbers
    <br />
    - periodic (wooo, aperiodic signal can be represented by periodic stuff only)

    <br />
    -- Make sure you check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qmNtSq2e5eM">this</a> out
  </div>

  <div>
    🤯 (optional)
    <br />
    underneath these functions of different personalities,
    <br />
    they all have the same "DNA" (polynomials)
    <br />
    they can all be represented just using polynomials and
    <a href="https://youtu.be/3d6DsjIBzJ4">here is an example</a>
  </div>



  <div> ⛓️ Chaining functions ⛓️ </div>

  <div> ⛓️ Chaining functions ⛓️
    <br />
    In short, we can feed the output of one function as the input to another function.
  </div>

  <div>
    me "小" as a function:
    <br />
    🍎 -> 小 -> lecture
    <br />
    小(🍎) = lecture
  </div>

  <div>
    🥃 -> 小 -> 🤪
    <br />
    小(🥃) = lEcTUrE
  </div>

  <div>
    you "CoolStudents" as a function:
    <br />
    lecture -> CoolStudents -> some times good sleep 💤
    <br />
    <small class="nowrap"> CoolStudents(lecture)= good sleep 💤 </small>
  </div>

  <div>
    we can chain functions together!
    <br />
    We have:
    <br />
    <small class="nowrap">小(🍎) = lecture</small>
    <br />
    and
    <br />
    <small class="nowrap"> CoolStudents(lecture)= good sleep 💤 </small>
    <br />
    We chain these up:
    <small class="nowrap"> CoolStudents(小(🍎))= good sleep 💤 </small>
  </div>

  <div>
    Note that the chained function CoolStudents(小(🍎))
    <br />
    is a different function than either 小(🍎) and CoolStudents(lecture)
    <br />
    in the sense that its input and output are not the same as those of the smaller functions.
    <br />
    - Basically by chaining functions together we get a new and "bigger" function.

  </div>

  <div> 😍 Recall a model can be a set of functions wired up together. Chaining functions together is how we can wire
    functions up to form an AI model! To be continued next week... </div>


  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>

  <div>
    Next, we are going to:
    <br />
    - take a look at how these functions can be implemented in python with help from NumPy!

  </div>

  <div>
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1euU7Dn-Z7JYkTBd76vHBUW9tt-UEWPZd?usp=sharing"> A prepared google
      colab notebook </a>
    <br /> 1. click on the link and open this google colab notebook
  </div>




  <div>
    Let's take a look at the notebook!
    <br />

    <br /> - 1. Make sure you have saved a copy to your GDrive or opened in playground. 🎉
    <br /> - 2. Read all text cells and code cells.
    <br /> - 3. Try out the only excercise (Excercise 1.).

  </div>

  <div> Today we have looked at:

    <br />
    Functions 🧑‍🎨
    <br />
    - A function relates an input to an output.
    <br />
    -- Function graphs
    <br />
    -- Several big namer functions including exp, sigmoid, quadratic, relu, sine, tanh (and they have characteristics)

    <br />
    -- Chain functions together to make a new function
    <br />
    -- Big namer functions implemented using NumPy

  </div>


  <div>
    We'll see you next Thursday same time and same place!
