  <div> By the end of this lecture, we'll have learnt about:

    <br /> The theoretical:
    <br /> - A gentle introduction to scalar, vector and matrix
    <br /> The practical:
    <br /> - A gentle introduction to Google colab notebook
    <br /> - Python basics 01
  </div>

  <div> First of all, don't forget to confirm your attendence on <a

  <div> Recap </div>

  <div>
    Numeric representation 🌶️
    <br /> - How do we use numbers to represent image, audio and text
    <br /> - The output from an image classification model: the image classes.
    <br /> - We can use one-hot encoding to represent image classes.
  </div>

    <div> generated by stable diffusion: “a screenshot of an ios face detector app”</div>
  </div>

  <div>
    Numeric representation 🌶️
    <br /> - The output from face detection models: bounding boxes and/or landmarks.
    <br /> - We can use coordinates to represent the location of a point within an image.
    <br /> - We can use the combination of [the coordinates of a chosen corner, its width, its height] to represent the
    location of a rectangle within an image.
  </div>

  <div>
    Today we are going to see numeric representations not on the white board, but on our computers in action!
  </div>

  <div> scalar, vector, matrix big picture:
    <br /> - different ways to organise numbers
    <br /> - cater for different data modalities
  </div>

  <div> Why do we need them?

    <br /> - We have to use numbers to represent stuff and one single number is often not enough.
    <br /> - There are usually many numbers hence it is inevitable to look at how these numbers are organised.

  </div>

  <div> Scalar:
    <br />
    one single number
  </div>

  <div> Morning noodling time!
    <br /> 🌶️ Q1: Example of data being a scalar? 🌤
  </div>

  <div> Vector:
    <br />
    - can be thought of as a list of numbers
    <br />
    - can be in a row or column
    <br />
    - The number of elements in a vector is called its length or, sometimes, its width.
  </div>

  <div> Noodling time!
    <br /> 🌶️ Q2: Example of data being a vector? 🌤🔈
  </div>

  
  <div> Noodling time!
    <br /> 🌶️ Q2.5: How about that dog-or-cat one-hot class label?
  </div>

  <div> <a href="https://youtu.be/NvsXDfhvT3I?si=Duc62xn_asw1gDCj">Matrix</a>
    <br />
    - can be thought of as an array of numbers
    <br />
    - or a list of vectors (with the same length)
    <br />
  </div>

  <div> Noodling time!
    <br /> 🌶️ Q3: Example of data being a matrix? 🩻

  <div> Noodling time!
    <br /> 🌶️ Q3: Example of data being a matrix?
    <br /> temporatures measured at different locations and times - tabular data! (on the whiteboard...)
  </div>

  <div> The shape of a matrix
    <br />
    - # of rows x # of columns
    <br />
    - (on whiteboard)
  </div>

  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>

    <div> 🌶️🌶️ Q4: What's the shape of this matrix? </div>
  </div>

  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>
    <img src='https://cdn.glitch.global/60e0bb7c-c728-41a2-965e-d0ee626232b0/example_mat.png?v=1697477716432' />
    <div> 2 x 3 </div>
  </div>

  <div> Vector can be seen as a special case of matrix,
    <br /> and we can describe the shape of a vector the same as matrix:
    <br /> - K rows x 1 column 😀
    <br /> - (let's draw a column vector on the whiteboard)
    <br /> - or 1 row x K columns 😀
    <br /> - (let's draw a row vector on the whiteboard)
  </div>

  <div> Till now we have looked at:
    <br />
    - scalar, vector and matrix
    <br />
    - how to describe their shapes
    <br />
    - how many rows x how many columns
    <br />
    - the convention is to put the number of rows in the front
  </div>

  <div> Next:
    <br />
    - Let's do some simple maths operation!
  </div>

  <div> Add two scalars together:
    <br /> easy, just add!
  </div>

  <div> Add two matrices together:

    <br /> easy, just add!
    <br /> but they have to be of the exactly same shape!

  </div>

  <div>

    🌶️🌶️What if I want to add a matrix of 2x3 and a matrix of 3x2 together?

  </div>

  <div>
    🌶️🌶️What if I want to add a matrix of 2x3 and a matrix of 3x2 together?
    <br />
    - Nope I can't, because it is not defined. 😤

  <div>
    Next, we are going to:
    <br />
    - take our first look at the google colab notebook!
    <br />
    - learn some very simple python basics!
    <br />
    - see how scalar, vector and matrix are used in python
  </div>

  <div>

      colab notebook </a>
    <br /> 1. click on the link and open this google colab notebook
  </div>

  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>
    <img src='https://cdn.glitch.global/60e0bb7c-c728-41a2-965e-d0ee626232b0/notebook1.png?v=1697479338383' />
    <div> 2. Open it in playground or save a copy to your google drive (recommended) </div>
  </div>


  <div>
    Demystify google colab notebook
    <br />
    Two types of cells ✌️
    <br /> - Text cell
    <br /> -- It is for passing information to other people reading the notebook.
    <br /> -- just like comment in swift, but with better layout.
    <br /> - Code cell:
    <br /> -- It is the actual programming part.
    <br /> -- It has a play button at the top left corner. ▶️
  </div>

    <div> Without explaining what the code is doing, here is a screenshot of a code cell and its output </div>
  </div>

  <div> How would you distinguish a code cell from a text cell? </div>

  <div> How would you distinguish a code cell from a text cell?
    <br /> - Code cells have grey-ish background.
    <br /> - Code cells have run buttons at the top left corner when you hover over.

  </div>

  <div>
    Let's take a look at the notebook!
    <br />

    <br /> - 1. Make sure you have saved a copy to your GDrive or opened in playground.
    <br /> - 2. Read all text cells and code cells one by one.
    <br /> - 3. Run all code cells and don't forget to read the comments in code cells.
    <br /> - 4. Ignore stuff after the text "This is the end of week 4"

  </div>

  <div> Little tasks 🌶️🌶️:
    <br /> - Add a text cell at the beginning of notebook and write down your name and your mood of the day 😈
    <br /> - Add a code cell below that text cell and write two lines of code:
    <br /> -- 1. Create a variable named "greetings" and assign a string value "bello" to it
    <br /> -- 2. Print the variable greetings using print(greetings)
    <br /> -- 3. Run the cell!!!
  </div>


  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>


  <div> Now let's advance to <a
      href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fI343lknGVtvOKBqtz1HMHE-Ug2EtwSe?usp=sharing"> the next notebook
      with python basics 01 </a>
  </div>



  <div> - Let's take a look at the notebook cell-by-cell till "Functions (week 5)"
    <br /> - Don't forget to make a copy to your GDirve 🎉
    <br /> - We are not expected to memorise the syntax.
    <br /> - The goal is to familiarise ourselves with the concept of:
    <br /> -- basic arithmetic in python 🧮
    <br /> -- lists in python 🧺
    <br /> -- strings in python 🔤
    <br /> -- conditionals in python ❓
    <br /> -- loops in python 🌀

  </div>

  <div> Finally the main theme:
    <br /> - scalar, vector and matrix in Python
    <br /> -- we will use a very popular library called "NumPy" to help us handling vectors and matrices.
    <br /> -- Take away message: In NumPy, all vectors and matrices are wrapped in NumPy "arrays" !

  </div>

  <div> - Let's take a look at the notebook cell-by-cell:
    <br /> - From "Numpy" to "Reshape NumPy arrays (week 5)"
    <br /> - We are not expected to memorise the syntax.
    <br /> - The goal is to familiarise ourselves with the concept of:
    <br /> -- how to create numpy arrays using python lists 🧚
    <br /> -- how to check the shape of a numpy array 💠
    <br /> -- how to add two arrays together ➕
    <br /> -- how images and audios are represented using numpy arrays in action 📢
    <br /> -- You are welcome to take notes of unfamiliar notions/syntax and search for explanations (either from the
    internet or us)
  </div>

  <div> Till now we have looked at:
    <br />
    - How to use google colab notebook
    <br />
    - Python basics:
    <br />
    -- variables, print method, lists, stringsm conditionals, loop
    <br />
    - NumPy
    <br />
    -- vector and matrix as Numpy arrays
    <br />
    -- shapes of Numpy arrays
    <br />
    -- add two Numpy arrays
    <br />
    -- can confirm: images and audios can live in the matrix
  </div>


  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>



  <div> An example of running fun "niche" AI models using colab notebook:
    <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/shengyu-meng/dreamfields-3D"> a text-to-3D model called dreamfield </a>
    <br />
    - Have you seen the "Open in Colab" button?
  </div>

  <div> Let's play with the dreamfield Colab notebook
    <br />
    <a href="https://github.com/shengyu-meng/dreamfields-3D"> a text-to-3D model called dreamfield </a>
    <br />
    - 1. Open the notebook by clicking the "Open in Colab" button in the readme section.
    <br />
    - 2. Run all the code cells except the marked "optional" ones.
    <br />
    - 3. Some cells take a long time to run and you can expand the cell to see what it is doing.
    <br />
    - 4. Prompt_text under "Training Settings" is where you can type in your own prompt.
    <br />
    - 4.5. Maybe enter a small value of Epoch_num under "Training Settings" if you are in a hurry.
    <br />
    - 5. If you have entered a new prompt, make sure you run the following code cells again to get the updated results.

  </div>
