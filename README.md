### Block 1 Structure

Block 1 consists of three units, studied in parallel:

1. **Coding One: Swift and SwiftUI**. Drawing on Apple‚Äôs "Develop in Swift Fundamentals" curriculum, this unit gives you the opportunity to develop coding skills in the Swift language and introduces the Swift GUI frameworks key to the practice of Apple application development and prototyping. The unit is delivered in weekly coding classes that start with an introduction to coding practice for creatives using Swift. This unit recognises varying levels of coding experience in the diploma cohort and will provide a solid grounding in key computational concepts key to the work in the other units of the diploma. This unit also contains an introduction to assessment via practical exams and tests through formative mock exams and test prior to the final assessment. Unit taught by [Joel](https://joelgethinlewis.com). [Coding One Moodle link (UAL access only) TBC](TBC). Learning outcomes:
   1. Code application development assets in Swift (Knowledge, Process)
   2. Demonstrate the use of the Swift GUI frameworks for application development (Knowledge, Process)
   3. Use Xcode and online repository tools to collaborate and support your development process and manage your code (Knowledge, Process)
2. **ML One**: Introducing Machine Learning with CoreML. The unit is a mix of practical tasks introducing the core Apple Machine Learning (ML) frameworks and seminars that look at emerging practice across the arts and creative industries that employ some level of artificial intelligence. This unit also critically and ethically explores ML and its potential impact on culture and society. From this exploration you will use your new understanding of ML methods and your critical framework to develop ML applications on the Apple platform. Unit taught by [Xiaowan](https://xiaowan-yi.com). [ML One Moodle link (UAL access only) TBC](TBC). Learning outcomes:
   1. Describe how machine learning works in practice (Knowledge)
   2. Discuss artificial Intelligence as a cultural concept (Enquiry)
   3. Construct applications with the CoreML framework (Process)
3. **Spatial One: Team App Design, User Experience Research and Rapid prototyping**. Drawing on Apple‚Äôs "Develop in Swift Explorations" curriculum, this unit explores the process of designing apps for the visionOS platform and introduces UX methodologies, collaborative development approaches and high-fidelity prototyping using Apple tools. From this exploration you will be able to move from initial wireframes to interactive prototypes that make use of the affordances of the Apple platform and serve your intended users well. This unit will include an introduction to the history of Spatial Computing. This unit also includes an introduction to concepts of inclusivity and ethical practice within the design of digital systems as well as an introduction to assessment via design presentation through formative presentations prior to the final assessment. Unit taught by [Joel](https://joelgethinlewis.com). [Spatial One Moodle link (UAL access only) TBC](TBC). Learning outcomes:
   1. Describe and communicate an visionOS app concept (Knowledge, Communication)
   2. Employ relevant methods of user research (Enquiry, Process)
   3. Produce visionOS application prototypes (Realisation)

### Block 2 Structure

Block 2 consists of three units, studied in parallel:

1. **Coding Two: Further Apple Frameworks**. This unit explores further Apple frameworks for developing on visionOS. With this introduction you will be able to create engaging experiences on the visionOS platform and explore some of the advanced features of the Apple platform such as RealityKit, ARKit and Vision. Unit taught by [Joel](https://joelgethinlewis.com). [Coding Two Moodle link (UAL access only) TBC](TBC). Learning outcomes:
   1. Identify how games are developed on visionOS (Process)
   2. Employ game development tools and frameworks for visionOS (Enquiry)
   3. Demonstrate foundational concepts of app design (Knowledge)
2. **ML Two: Making Models with CreateML**. This unit explores the creation of bespoke Machine Learning models using Apple tools and specifically the CreateML framework. You will explore common ML and AI methods building from scratch functional ML prototypes rather than relying on ones pre-supplied by Apple. This is to give you a functional understanding of the data requirements of ML models, the use of computer vision systems and the process converting models to the Apple platform. The unit will also introduce you to ways of evaluating your models for potential issues of bias and discrimination. Unit taught by [Xiaowan](https://xiaowan-yi.com). [ML Two Moodle link (UAL access only) TBC](TBC). Learning outcomes:
   1. Describe how to build ML models (Knowledge, Communication)
   2. Demonstrate how to use the CreateML framework (Process)
   3. Describe approaches to evaluate your model for bias and discrimination (Enquiry)
3. **Spatial Two: Individual App Design and Launch**. In this unit you will develop the app concept for Apple‚Äôs visionOS. This will give you both an understanding of the development process using the standard Apple development tools and build on your Swift learning in an applied context. This unit will also introduce content creation methods for visionOS - including scene creation in Reality Composer Pro and photogrammetry to create 3D content for your apps from real world objects and spaces. The aim of the unit is to expose you to the full App development process including launching on the Apple App Store. Unit taught by [Joel](https://joelgethinlewis.com). [Spatial Two Moodle link (UAL access only) TBC](TBC). Learning outcomes:
   1. Describe what makes a successful app (Knowledge, Process, Communication)
   2. Describe the process of launching on the Apple App store (Enquiry)
   3. Solve common development problems in app production (Realisation)

## Assessment

## UAL-wide assessment criteria

Please read [UAL's guidance for students on how they will be assessed](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment). [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR): you will be assessed on the following 5 assessment criteria (quoting from [UAL's page](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment)):

1. **Enquiry**
   - Enquiry is about active learning and reflection. It‚Äôs how you explore, research and learn about your subject. Enquiry is central to all creative learning at UAL.
2. **Knowledge**
   - Knowledge is about gathering information and enhancing understanding. It‚Äôs how you inform your work, explore diverse cultures and connections and appreciate what you do in a wider context.
3. **Process**
   - Process is about your journey of learning. It‚Äôs how you take risks and experiment. And how you keep the creative momentum going ‚Äî developing ideas from start to finish.
4. **Communication**
   - Communication is about telling the story of your learning and making. It‚Äôs how you share your learning with an audience, presenting and explaining your work to different people.
5. **Realisation**
   - Realisation is about the work you create and how this reveals what you‚Äôve learned. It‚Äôs taking a look back and evaluating the work you‚Äôve produced.
